Once upon a time, in the faraway lands of the Orient, three wise men began a long journey guided by a dazzling star: the star of Bethlehem. On the backs of their camels, they rode day and night without rest until they came to Bethlehem to attend the birth of the Baby Jesus. On reaching the stable, they knelt before the newborn to deliver to him three presents. The first, worthy of a king: gold. The second, fit for a man: myrrh. And the third, the offering a God deserves: incense. At this point they were blessed with the gift of giving presents to all the world's boys and girls. And their names became a reason for celebration. Since then, year after year, Melchior, Caspar y Balthazar, the Three Kings, have kept taking love, joy, and harmony wherever they go. TODAY Come on now! Move it! They'll give us the grapes here! Calm and serenity, Melchior, a little patience. Hey, you, hold it. Where are you going? Stop! DECEMBER 22 Move it! Holy shit! I've had it up to my crown! I knew the 22nd was a bad day to cross. Oh, yeah? Then why the heck didn't you say anything? Of course I did, several times, but since you don't listen to me... To me or anyone. I've been listening to you for 2000 years. Don't do that, you'll stress them out. Finally! Good evening. Show me your papers. What is this? Is this possible? Here too? They're gonna shit themselves. Here come the Kings, with the Christmas gift! Watch these guys, they're very merry. They bring the boy-child beautiful gifts! Green butterfish... Lemon leaves... The Virgin Mary, mother of the Lord. Papers. Paco, Felipe and Oriol. -Anything to declare? -No, sir. What was that? -It's my cellphone. -My tummy. -His tummy. -His cellphone. Out of the vehicle now and open up the back. I'm going to open the door. Guardia Civil here. What the hell...? No, don't do that, they get stressed out. Will you give them back the...? Lad, drop the gun. -Don't shoot! -I can't! -I'm talking to him! -It was an accident. I have a wife and two kids. No, no, we know that. Mari Carmen, Rebe and Juancar. But listen, we have no intention of hurting you. -Right, friends? -True, true. Still, you can forget the HD tablet, the speedcross trainers and the Rosanna disc, Juanito. You know them? How do you know them? What is this, magic? What the hell...? The men from the van, you're surrounded! Hands up! And these guys? Juanito, do you want to see some proper magic? Look, These guys? Where are they? Where did they go? Tell the commander. What the hell happened here? Jesus, Mary and Joseph! What a welcome. That was close. Remind you of something? Yes. What times they were, eh? Good evening. What's this? That, madam, is myrrh. What's it for? Not even God knows. THE THREE WISE MEN VS SANTA DECEMBER 23RD BELÉN GUESTHOUSE - BEDS We've been to the four corners of the Earth, and this is still my favorite spot. Yeah, yeah... I'm going to bed, my back's a mess from so much camel. Besides, remember, we have a meeting tomorrow. You're making it worse. And be careful with Belén, all we need is for her to find out who you are. What do you mean? Belén and I are just friends. Besides, I know very well that we mustn't get involved in the non-magical world. Have you changed your hair? Well, considering we haven't seen each other for a year... I've cut it four or five times. -Well, you look very pretty. -Thanks. You're looking good too. So? How's life going, Belén? Not as well as you guys. It's incredible, you haven't changed at all in years. It's you, Belén, you look kindly upon us. No, I know you have a secret... and I want to know what it is. They're here! -Run! -Be good, don't run! Sofía! Bea! How are you? -Sofía, you're so big! -Hello, Felipe! Hi! It's great to see you! Hi! How are you, little ones? -Good, and how are you? -Hi, girl. Hello, Paco. What's that? Don't tell me, the letter to the Three Kings. It's the letter to Santa. He's the best. Why not write to the Magi instead? They're plan B. What Santa doesn't bring, you ask them for. The Kings aren't plan B, they're plan A, the main course. Santa's like the bowl of olives while you wait to get served. Look, Oriol, I took your advice and I've been reading all year. Very good, Sofia! Nothing like a good book on... MYTHS OF THE KRAMPUS Sofía, what are you doing reading this? The Krampus is an evil being who hates Christmas. He feeds on hate and abducts and punishes boys and girls like you. Aren't you scared? I don't believe in the Krampus and that crap, okay? They're stories for little kids, like Santa Claus, the Three Kings, Harry Potter... You don't believe in the Three Kings? -I believe in them. -That's the way I like it. -And who's your favorite? -Any except the one in the middle. "The one in the middle"? That depends on how they line up. We don't know if there's life in outer space! MAYOR But we can assure you that if there is, they'll be dazzled by the 15 million lights that will decorate our streets! He's always loved Christmas. Almost more than us. He's elected every year, the people adore him. Alright... Are you sure this is the right time? Hold on, I'll look again. You look, your eyes are better. "Tra-pe-co ardu-bialen..." But that's not the time. It was around here, I saw it. It has to be further down, I don't know. Those camels... It's further down, further down. El Niño Lottery. A sure thing. Thanks, but we're not interested. Yes, at 12. I said: "A sure thing". You got your answer. Thanks, we're not interested. Excuse me, are you the new page? She's the new page. Sorry, they change the password all the time. -Ana Ruiz, at Your Majesties' service. -What are you doing? Get up -Melchior touched me! -Be discreet, lass. I'm just excited, you know? You've been my favorite king forever. And you're Balthazar, my sister's king. I admire you so much... And you're Caspar. How are you? Everything alright? Great, great. Let's not waste any more time. You have a lot to see, let's go. I can't believe I'm about to enter the Magical World. This is amazing. The best day of my life. I've always wondered how you get into the Magical World and in class they're so secretive about it. It must be incredible. Is it here? How does it work? Iris scan, voice recognition, fingerprint reader? Look. The key. With the key. -I'm a real page. -In training. Yes, of course. The outfits are so cool! Cool? Uncomfortable! Listen, these pants ride up... they get up in my crack and... Just as well we only transform in the Magical World. Well, except on January 5th, the day you do the parade and hand out the presents. All that day you transform in the real world, right? Welcome to the city of the Three Kings. Gee! Majesties... Majesties... -Where are we going now? -Patience, you'll see. This is the reading room. Here we examine all of the letters that reach us and cross-check them with their annual behavior report. "I'm Silvia Martínez and this year I want a Dobble card game, well, and the boardgame Hotel, if that's possible". Yes, and maybe you'll finish your lentils. You always leave your plate untouched. Go on, ease up on her. No, no, Silvia has to ease up on her mother. They're tough, aren't they? Not if you've behaved. I'm freaking out! It's all done by hand! I thought it was a myth. Of course, Ana, we're true artisans. As we like to say: There's no modernity... Without fine tradition! In this alley the requests are prepared from the letters read before. That's great! And right there, another kind of request is prepared. This is the page Carbonilla. He prepares the coal for the boys and girls who misbehaved during the year. Not the greatest job, but someone has to do it, right, Carbonilla? -I guess. -And this? -For David Pastor Junior. -Three bags of coal. Atrocious! Now I understand why his father asked for a barbecue. And here's where our loyal friends, the messenger hawks, deposit the letters that are sent to us, the Magi. Look, Ana, see that pile? They're letters for me. All of them are for you? And those over there are mine. Incredible! And yours, Caspar? That pile there. My letters arrive at the last moment because... my fans trust me. No way! Is that King Cake? Yes. Always with a keen eye, watching over so that not a single letter is lost. Delighted, the pleasure's mine. -You speak Hawk? -Yes, C1 level, spoken and written. Impressive. Shall we continue? For now, and until you become an official page, you'll go with us everywhere. -You have to meet the CUBMOB. -Cool. For the Kings today, make way, make way! Pretty cool, huh? C.U.B.M.O.B., COMMITTEE OF THE UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOODS OF MAGICAL AND OUTLANDISH BEINGS Wow, this is awesome! Good morning, girl! Good morning, everyone! Good morning. Good morning. How were your holidays? Short, as usual. This year I went to the Seychelles. All day in the sun! The first witch to like being toasted. That's true! Yo, Kings! What's up? All good? Here, another year handing out hope and joy. That's Befana, the Italian witch, and Olentzero, the coalman from the Basque Country and Navarra. And who is that? Yule the goat, a magical Christmas being in the Nordic countries. Actually, he's just decoration. I'm a goat, but I'm not deaf. Deaf I am not. This is all so amazing! The best is yet to come. Befana, hey, wait for me! The ceilings are so high! Highnesses, you're on the list. Go ahead! Good morning. Your name. You should know that my name is Melchior. King Melchior. Oh, yes... Excuse me, Majesty. Go right ahead! Ana Ruiz, trainee page. Ana Ruiz, yes, we were advised. -I'm... -I know who you are! Hey, brother. How are you? Good! I'm King Caspar. Okay, okay... I'm sorry, but we don't have any Caspar. My God! So many people! And all of them bring Christmas presents? All of them, although the real function of this gathering is to organize, protect ourselves and reach agreements. What's that flower? That's the Easter Flower. The Christmas spirit lives inside it. -Watch it! -Careful, you're on the Invisible Man. Sorry. -What's up, Kings? -I haven't seen you in ages. Yes, I've been staying out of sight lately. -Let's see each other more this year. -Yes, see you. Hold on, I'll shift up. Who are they up there? They're a mixed bag. The Cantabrian El Esteru, L'Anguleru, Asturian, the Apalpador, Galician, and the Tió, who craps out gifts in Catalonia and Aragón. He craps them out? Boys and girls hit him with canes so he defecates presents. Don't shit me, Tomte. Tomte, every year the same thing. -Don't give me stick! -Then don't be a plank! Is that Elsa from "Frozen"? I thought she wasn't real. No, get outta here, that's Schnegurowska, a messenger fairy who conveys the dreams of boys and girls all over Russia. Her heart is ice, making her the world's most neutral magical being. That's why we chose her as Chancellor of CUBMOB. Are you comfortable like that? Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. And Ded Moroz, Grandfather of the Snows and of the Chancellor too. He looks a lot like Santa Claus. No, how can you compare Ded to that freak? By the way, I haven't seen him. I love not seeing him. The session will begin shortly. Go for them, Elf 1. This is priceless. Do I really have to read this? "Since the beginning of time, Christmas has been synonymous with Santa Claus, but that's over now". Good, about time! "Get ready to receive as he deserves the new symbol of Christmas". Presenting... the one and only, improved, the children's favorite, the unrivalled: SANTA 2.0! Buffoon. How's my CUBMOB? I can't hear you! I said: "How's my CUBMOB"? Long live Christmas! Love you guys! Merry Christmas! Ciao. So, can I go in now? I'm sorry, but my supervisor says there's no Geppetto in the files. Geppetto? My name's Caspar, King Caspar. What's going on in there? I'm sorry, but... you can't come in. I'll call again and check, but... While some prefer to use scrolls, messenger birds or go by camel, so to speak. So to speak, he says. Myrrh off, man. Kids today prefer technology, not stuff from the past like myrrh or incense. That's why I, Santa 2.0, have decided to reinvent myself and adapt to the new times. I present the Santa Watch, a device not only accurate to 50 milliseconds and holographic projection, but is also linked up to... my new TULSA sports sleigh, 100% electric and long-range. And with my new friends, no more going down filthy chimneys. Getting dirty every year and covered in soot is a thing of the past. Now they'll do the dirty work for me and these flying gadgets... don't complain. I've also decided to stop living in Lapland and I've moved to this new castle, for the sole and indisputable King of Christmas! King? Tell me he didn't say "king". Yes, yes, he said it, he said it. But that's not all. I am so happy, so proud, so excited... to share this with you today. It's a new chapter in the history of Christmas. The future. No way, he's "overstepped the manger" now. Who does he think he is? He's a dummy designed to sell soft drinks. Relax, buddy. All we have to do is ignore him. He's got his public and we have ours. We needn't make pointless comparisons or personal slights. -I'll have my own parade! -What the hell is fatso on about?! Did you hear him? Did you? Dance, Elf 1. Be happy. Objection! I feel forced to interrupt this santaclaustic exhibition of ego. The parade has always been ours, the Magi. Not for nothing is it Christmas' most magical night. Bear it in mind, bear it in mind. Yes, whatever you say, but Chancellor, shouldn't we revise the bases of this committee? That's ridiculous! Bro, chill. Ridiculous is bringing presents on January 6th. That's not Christmas, CUBMOB. Did he call me "bro"? The poor kids barely have time to play because two days later they go back to school. They go back to school, come on! Chancellor, are you really going to allow this takeover? What do you think of a vote? I think it's neither bad nor good. Those in favor of Santa's parade? Hey, relax, I'm sorting it out. Sorting out what? Sneaking off? Lay off, man. He got his own way in the end, he beat us. Beat us? Who? This year Caca Claus is holding the parade! Santa stole our parade? What did I tell you? Plus he has the support of all of CUBMOB. This is unbelievable. Fine, he encroaches on us every year, but taking what's ours... What is this? Hey, didn't you realize that I wasn't in there with you? What? The children forgetting me hurts, but my best friends forgetting me too, really, guys... Hey! The Three Kings of Methuselah! Did you like my parade thing? Any suggestions? Look, Santa, I'm in no mood for your shit, okay? Shit? What kind of language is that? What would the children say if they heard you? They'd say: "Mom, who's that?" I'm King Caspar. I'm King Crapster. Let it go, let it go. -King Caspar. -Who? I'm saying I'm King Caspar. And I say: Who cares? -Caspar, come on, let's go. -Ignore him, let's go. The road to Bethlehem goes down the valley that the snow covered The little shepherds want to see their king, they bring him gifts in their humble shepherd's pouch. He was born in a stable in Bethlehem, the Baby Jesus. I wish to place at your feet a present to your liking, Lord. You know I am poor as well and have only an old drum. Enough! I said enough! Don't you know what you could awaken? According to the legend, the Krampus was an evil being who, for a long time, stalked boys and girls all over the world at Christmas, until one day he was defeated. They say that that day he lost all his powers and his body vanished into thin air, although a small part of him managed to survive: His shadow! These days, he's still somewhere, asleep under the power of Christmas, too weak to awaken. But if, one day, the Christmas spirit withers, Krampus' shadow will awaken from its forced lethargy and attempt by any means to end Christmas forever, for only this way will he recover his original body and all his powers. His shadow will roam the streets, seeking the perfect person to possess. What are you still doing here, Marquitos? Go home, this is the time to spend with the family. I appreciate it, Mayor. -Merry Christmas. -Same to you. And Marquitos, don't forget to give Esther a kiss from me. Are you alright, Mayor? Better than ever. And the only way to do away with him will be to pierce his heart with the original Christmas Star, an immensely powerful relic. What's all this about? You said you don't believe in this stuff, right? But you do and I like scaring you because you're a chicken. I'm not a chicken! Do you have any idea how serious this is? This is CUBMOB, you are CUBMOB, and if you want to stay CUBMOB, you have to act like CUBMOB, got it? -It's not fair! -But he started it! You always let him do whatever he wants. -Do you doubt my impartiality? -I think he did. -Why don't you shut up? -Everyone shut up! I suggest you leave here right now. Because anything you may say or do from now on will only worsen your situation. By the way, my dear Kings, a question before you go. What do you think I should throw from my float? Chocolates, or giant candy that injures the kids like you do? You'll pay for this, you lowdown ass, you hear? I swear to you, this isn't over. Silence! Get out of here! Christmas is the best time of year. Right, my tiny friend, Elf 1? Yeah, I love Christmas. Elf, come to me! What was that voice? What voice? What are you talking about? You must be tired. Go and rest, little slacker. I know you hate Christmas as much as I do. Help me and we'll destroy it together. I don't understand, I thought you magical beings got along. No, we get along, but this darn Santa has been sowing discord for centuries. Normally we don't behave like this. Right, Caspar? Yeah. Whatever you say. Good night. Rudolph, music. Activating music. Mayor, I'm thrilled to present my parade project to you. I think if we hurry, my elves can have it all ready by tomorrow, the 25th. I want it to be a daytime parade so that the boys and girls can enjoy their gifts while their parents have a vermouth, a little tequila... I want it to be a parade in grand style because... Rudolph, music. Rudolph, music! Rudolph, music! Closing curtains. What's he doing? Rudolph, open the curtains and put on some music! I'm sorry, this normally doesn't happen to us. Surprise. DECEMBER 24TH, CHRISTMAS EVE It looks like singing isn't one of her talents. No, not really, no. Listen, do you think Caspar's upset about what happened at the CUBMOB? Among other things. We must understand him. Aren't you going out partying with Paco and Oriol? I don't feel like it. What a shame. Because... I feel like dancing. Look, Balta, we've been doing this for over 2000 years. We are and will be Kings forever, -for better... -Or for worse. Don't worry, old friend. He'll get over it. I hope so. We have a problem. Do you still think that magic doesn't exist? We're going to stay up all night so we can see Santa when he brings the presents. Are you crazy or what? What is it? Oh, I know. You're scared that I'm right and you're not, true? Do you feel like... a drink? Yes. I'll be right back. Don't move. Caspar... We've come for you. We're wanted in the magical world. What? Can't it be in a little while? No. Code Red. Let's go. Code Red. Listen, Felipe... Do you like tonic? Ask your king. What's that about our king? Hey, don't point, don't point. Calm! Calm. We all agree that it's slightly worrying that Santa Claus is untraceable, this being Christmas Eve. Do you know anything? No. -Sure? -Sure. Excuse me, Chancellor, did you summon us because you think we're involved? -Yes. -Yes. Yes? No. I summoned you because tonight is the most magical night of Christmas. All the boys and girls in the world are waiting for the arrival of Santa Claus. But if tomorrow they discover that he hasn't come, it would put in grave danger the Christmas spirit and all of you. Someone has to deliver his presents. You're not working tonight. -Excuse me, Chancellor, but we can... -No! You'll do it just like Santa, understood? Yes, ma'am. Hey, not this. Why on earth would we stoop to something like this? Why on earth? Because tomorrow, when the sun comes up and the children don't find Santa Claus' presents under the tree, you will be immediately and permanently expelled from CUBMOB. Oh, that's why. Okay, okay. Right then. When things are made clear... Crystal clear. Where am I? Where am I? Help! Someone help me, I'm Santa! What is this? Help, please! Krampus. I see that, despite everything, you haven't forgotten me, old friend. Krampus, it's Christmas, the children await their presents. Please, what do you want? Tell me, what do you want? You know very well. You people did this to me. You took away my powers and my body. When I do away with Christmas forever, I'll recover my original body and all my powers, then no boy or girl in the world will ever be safe from me again. You won't get away with it, Krampus. You think by kidnapping me you'll do away with Christmas? That won't happen. No! That won't be enough. But when the boys and girls wake up tomorrow and see that Santa hasn't come, I'll be closer to accomplishing my aim. Nice try, but there's no signal here for your modern gadget. There's nothing you can do. Friends, I'm sure there's an explanation as to why Santa has deserted us at the worst possible time. No, don't cry. No. While we find out, we must settle for these three dorks endorsed by the Commission. Excuse me, reindeer-groomer, but we Magi were delivering gifts long before this Santa Claws. It's a piece of cake for us. Yes, but is it really necessary for us to dress like jackasses? How do I explain this? The children are expecting Santa, so Santa will give them their gifts. And shake a leg, eh? It's barely an hour until sunrise. Hold it right there. Pump your brakes. There's plenty of time, but only if we do it our way. Okay. Okay, okay. Friends, it's time to hand out presents. Let's go. Stop! Wow, the ladder! You're kidding, right? You hold onto it. Watch and learn. You'll spend half your lives handing out presents. Whatever it takes. Can't you see we've stopped time? Could time be turned back with your method? It could. But we don't feel like it. It'd be very dangerous. The consequences could be catastrophic. We'd face a terrible paradox capable of causing such a chain reaction that it would reformulate the space-time continuum. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I'm so tanked! This mania for putting out alcohol in the house! I'm just being polite, got it? You have to understand me too. What's going on? Is this normal? -No. -It's weird. Let's get out of here. Now we're really in a jam. Bugger it. DECEMBER 25, CHRISTMAS It's daytime. Do you still expect Santa to come? You'll see that he came! I told you. Magic doesn't exist. But it has to... No, okay? Cut it out. How could you fail in your mission? You just had to do what you've done for 2000 years. Something or someone sabotaged us. We don't know. I do know. This witch thinks this is no accident. She thinks you're responsible for Santa's disappearance. -It's true, it's true. -They hit him! Thugs! They've always been jealous of him! Every magical being knows it, eh? -Thugs, thugs! -Hold on a moment! You don't think we'd be capable of doing something like this? Yes, it had to be them. Of course it was them. -Right? -I don't believe anything. Not one side or the other. Dear companions... Alright... Why would we do something like this? For a long time you've found him unbearable. You told me yourself one day that you were sick of cultural invasion. You couldn't bear it that boys and girls prefer to write to Santa than you. So you made him disappear! Never, ever, have I seen anything like this in CUBMOB! Betrayal! I said betrayal! Betrayal! Betrayal! Betrayal! You've enormously weakened the Christmas spirit. We all know how dangerous that could be. The terrible consequences that this could mean if... -I've no choice but to expel... -Chancellor! Perhaps we should remind those present here of Principio Indubidus Pronatale, included in article 11.3 of the Christmas Accord. Perhaps not everyone is as aware of it as you and I. Of course. But you remind them, my voice is a little hoarse. Every defendant has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and as there is no evidence of the Kings' guilt, I assume that CUBMOB will initiate a large-scale investigation before passing judgement. Sure, of course. This girl sure is well trained. She sure is. Thank you. I was just about to say so before you interrupted me. I have no choice but to initiate an investigation into what happened. Mission accomplished. The Kings have... They've failed. Look who's here. Do you know my elf buddy? Just kidding. I know you know each other. He was your friend, he betrayed you, blah, blah, blah... I'll leave you now, you have a lot to talk about. How could you, Elf 1? You're my friend. Your friend? Don't make me laugh. You've always treated me like a slave. And this "Elf 1" thing... I can't stand it. But I call you Elf 1 because you're the best. You're number one! You've never seen me as a friend. I mean the same to you as your crappy drones. I swear, if I acted like an idiot, it's because I'm an idiot, not because I don't consider you to be my friend. But allying with the Krampus? What happened to you? At what point did you abandon reason for madness? Madness was working for you. Krampus treats me as a friend, as an equal. We're like Batman and Robin. Like Timon and Pumba. Like Will and Fog. Do you understand? He respects me. Smurf, cut the chatter. Move it, we have work to do! You see? We even give each other nicknames. Where's Simpleton Santa gotten to? Do you think something bad has happened to him? Something bad, to Santa? Please! Right now he's laughing at us. How can you be so sure? Worrying about him is a waste of time. We know him. Go on up, I'll be right there. Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Where...? What happened to you? I was worried. No, it's all fine. Something came up and... It's alright, don't worry. Well, it looks like... Christmas this year has gone to hell. Yes. I heard something, yes. Listen, can we talk about what happened last night? Yes. Look... I like you. You like me? What did Schnegurowska mean that weakening the Christmas spirit could have terrible consequences? You see, the Christmas spirit is more important and powerful than you can imagine. It not only enables the existence of magical beings, it also protects the world from evil and the wicked creatures that, if Christmas didn't exist, would sow chaos and terror all over the world. When our actions aren't exemplary, the Christmas spirit withers and our magic along with it. Do you really think Santa would run such a huge risk just to annoy you? -Yes. -Are you kidding? -Would he endanger the Magical World? -No doubt. And the existence of all the magical beings? Of course. And the person he loves most in the world as well? Himself, Santa Claus. Seriously? You see? We have to find him. Not only to prove your innocence, but to save the Christmas spirit. What could we do? Not much. It's frankly impossible. Impossible? Are you serious? The same guys who 2000 years ago crossed a desert in search of a newborn baby are the same ones that now can't find a bearded man with magical powers who travels in a sports sleigh? That wasn't bad at all, eh? Not bad at all. -It was mythical. -Unique. -Epic. -Spectacular. Right then. Supposing we did it, we could start by sending our messenger hawks to search for clues worldwide. Good. And if our pages indicate the clues on a map, we could find a pattern. -That's right, Melchior. -Good, Balthazar. Let's go. You're the guy I see once a year for two weeks and then goes again. My daughters are the most important thing for me and they don't deserve to let someone in who won't stay and who always has something more urgent to do. But... Understand me a little too. Felipe. Come on, let's go! Now? Felipe! But why now? It's very urgent. Guys, as you know, Santa Claus has disappeared. We've sent a squadron of hawks in search of him, so I need you to look north and you south, okay? -Yes, let's go. -Let's go, guys. DECEMBER 26 Where? DECEMBER 28, PARIS DECEMBER 31, NEW YEAR'S EVE After the terrible loss of Christmas, we're now left without New Year's Eve due to a strange breakdown of the clock. Help! JANUARY 2, MEXICO CITY Guide us, Lord, and help us find damned Caca Claus. I knew you hadn't abandoned us! After two millennia you finally remember us! Is it Him? Federal Police! Throw down your sacks and get down off the camels! We've found clues in all these places. Tell us, Zambomba. He says it's here. TYRRANICAL MONARCHY KINGS OUT What's this all about? JANUARY 4 Santa! Will someone help me? Christmas is over! Elf,... help. King Cake? Is it you? SANTA WISHES YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS ONE IS WORTH THREE What a fraud. Another red herring. "One is worth three". What a braggart. I still don't believe CUBMOB said we hate him because we're jealous. -Jealous? Of what? -Of what? He's a lame duck, always so annoying. All he's done is ruin our lives. I can't bear him one day more. Poor wretch. It must be tough being absolutely no one's favorite. Nobody. Don't go overboard, he has his fans. A handful. Besides, because of him CUBMOB may kick us out. He started the fight, not us. Let them kick him out. Sir, do you have a minute to help our friends the whales? Your friends the whales? Look, I'll tell you something. Sometimes you think the whales are your friends, but watch it, you never know what they'll say behind your back. We're jealous of Santa... It doesn't make a lick of sense. Envy him, why? -Because he's world famous? -Because his sleigh flies? -Jealous of what? -Of what? By the way, the hawks need an ophthalmologist. It's odd that they can't tell a real person from a photo. Delivering message. Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar! The Krampus has awoken! He's possessed the Mayor and wants to do away with Christmas forever! He's holding me here, in the Town Hall basement. Sofía! There's no time! Come on, Kings! Can you come? Melchior! Caspar! What do you want? The Krampus has awoken! Santa's come! He's in the living room! What are you saying? Making things up, really, you're such a pest! There's no time! Come on, Kings! Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar! The Krampus has awoken! He's possessed the Mayor and wants to do away with Christmas forever! Hurry, he's getting away! Where's Mom? Forget about Mom now. Look, there he is! Hurry, he's getting away! -Hurry, he's getting away! -I'm doing my best, okay OK? Bea, that way, hurry! I told you magic exists! Belén? Belén? Belén! What's wrong? -Tell me. -Belén... I've decided I want to stay here. No more emergencies. I want... to stay here with you, and with the girls. Belén, this is my place. I'm sorry. I have to go. Why? What's wrong? The girls aren't here. -But... -They're not here. -OK... -I don't know where they are. OK, I'll go with you. Relax, OK? Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar! The Krampus has awoken! He's possessed the Mayor and wants to do away with Christmas forever! There he is. He's holding me here, in the... One... -There's no time! -Two... Come on, Kings! Now! He got away! What do we do now? Santa needs our help. He's holding me here, in the Town Hall basement. There's no time! Come on, Kings! And he'll get it. -Where did this man get to? -I don't know. -He can't have gone forever, right? -No. -Really? -I'm calling Belén. Hi, Belén, how are you? Sorry, I wanted to know if... What? She says that Bea and Sofía have run off, she doesn't know... -Mom! -We're here. Belén, relax, they're here. Don't worry, we'll stay with them until you get here. We saw Santa, the Krampus is holding him in his basement. He needs help from the Three Kings to save Christmas. You girls sure have a vivid imagination, eh? Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar! The Krampus has awoken! He's possessed the Mayor and wants to do away with Christmas forever! He's holding me here, in the Town Hall basement. There's no time! Come on, Kings! Shit, I can't believe I'm asking those three for help. Is it still recording? They're right. The Krampus. He's back. Ana, stay with the girls until Belén gets back. -Melchior, there's no time to lose. -What did you just say? There's no time to lose. No, no, you called him Melchior. -No, no. -No. -So you're Balthazar... -No, no. -And Felipe is Caspar. -No! They're the Three Kings! -Goodbye to 2000 years of mystery. -Incredible! And they say you're the smartest of the three of us. Go on, go. -If Caspar comes back... -I'll tell him, yes. Good luck. And you, girls... Come on. They're the Three Kings! Christmas beings, the news is terrible. The Christmas spirit is dying. We don't have much time left. MYTHS OF THE KRAMPUS Here it says that the only way to get rid of the Krampus is to pierce his heart with the original Christmas Star. We have to find it. How? Do you know where the Star is? Well... The original Christmas Star is found in the Magical World. Number 11/2, CUBMOB Palace St. And can you take us there? Access is restricted, I'm not authorized for that. Sure, the questions you ask... If it's a mere watch, how could it? I'm not a mere watch. If I wanted, I could do it perfectly well. I'll show you. Activating sleigh. No Kings gifts for them this year. Relax, Belén. They're in their room, safe and sound. No need to worry. There we go! Surprise! -What's happening? -No idea. I'm as surprised as you are. Well, I think we only have one option. -Let's go. -Go ahead. I hope Caspar's not around anyone who knows him. JANUARY 5, TWELFTH NIGHT I swear I know nothing about this. Well, hey... Maybe... I do know something. The Kings are coming with the gift, they bring the child such lovely presents. The Mayor is expecting you. What? Jeez! And the other one? Never mind. Welcome, Kings. Where has that sleigh taken my daughters and why are you dressed like that? It's a long story, but I'm sure they're fine, don't worry. I'm sure it's all fine. I'll go for the girls... No! You're not going anywhere. Sorry? You're going with Melchior and Balthazar, they need your help. No way. Let them handle it alone. Did she say Melchior and Balthazar? -Yes. -What's wrong with you? How can you say that? They're your best friends and they need you! Friends? Friends don't laugh at you and call you sad and pathetic. Who said that about you? My supposed best friends! Melchior, Balthazar and their new friend! -So you're...? -Yes. Hey, one thing... Just a sec, Belén. -When did we say that? -At the service station. What? Don't pretend. I heard it perfectly. -The service station? -Yes, the service station. -This is really wild. -It is pretty wild, yes. -Now I get it. -What? You were going to give up being a Magi for me? Yes. We weren't talking about you, we were talking about Santa. Please, one at a time. But how could you give it up? You have the best job in the world. Boys and girls adore you. The Krampus has awoken. He's possessed the Mayor and kidnapped Santa Claus. Melchior and Balthazar went to rescue him, but they can't do it alone. You know something? You've always been my favorite King. And you always will be. Go on, move it. -The Town Hall? -It's around there. Don't worry, Belén, I'll go for the girls. -Magic exists! -And it's so cool! Look, the Christmas Star! Good evening from Town Hall Square. As you see, hundreds of people have come to the door of the building to protest at the lack of news about the Kings' parade. Tonight, Christmas is at stake and it's all in the hands of three people: the Three Kings. I'm honestly sorry that you're going to miss the show. But I want you to know that I'm eternally grateful to you. If not for your fight, I could never have woken up. Have a happy "Non-Christmas". I really am sorry. All this is my fault. My need to humiliate them was what awakened the Krampus. You know what they say: It takes two to make a fight. Jealousy. Yes, we admit it, we were jealous of you. We couldn't bear that every year you surpassed us in everything. What are you talking about? I'm the one who envies you. You are the originals, the all-time three, the Three Kings. The Kings! Always such friends, so united... Well... not so much now. Caspar has abandoned us. He's gone. We may never see him again. Such a sensitive and humble man. A heart on legs. He has only one flaw, that he's... -very touchy. -Very touchy. What? -Badmouthing me again? -Caspar! I'll see if I can find something to get you out of here. The mood here at Town Hall Square is getting tense. The parade should've started hours ago and we still have no news of the Three Kings. I'm inside. Our dear friend Caspar. You're back. Sure, Christmas has to be saved. And I can only do it with the help of... my best friends. Do you think this will work? We'll find out now. Alright... You can do it, Caspar. Give it all you've got! Smurf, clean all this up! Not long to go. WITH HIS BEST FRIEND ELF 1 ALWAYS TOGETHER Wait! Wait. This time, why don't you start with Balthazar? -What? -Didn't you say you trusted me? And I do trust you. -I trust you. -Okay. I really trust you! But... he does too. You trust him too? -Of course. -Start with Balthazar. Okay. Lil' guy! You came back. Yes. You were right. It's not that you're not my friend, you're just an idiot. Yes, that's what I told you, I'm an idiot. We have to hurry. We must stop the Krampus before he goes out and cancels the parade. If he does that, he'll recover his original form and we'll be powerless. Who are you two and what are you doing with Santa's sleigh? They've taken Santa. Santa has been kidnapped by the Krampus. Impossible. CUBMOB did away with him centuries ago. It's all a lie! It's not a lie! However terrible it may be, they're right. The Krampus has awoken, and we need the Christmas Star to defeat him. Are you one hundred percent sure? Yes. Have you seen it with your own eyes? Well, no, but... Then how can you assert this with such boldness and finality? The decision has been taken. The Star stays in its place, where it should be, in the Magical World. Who gave you the right to decide the future of Christmas? We are the Christmas beings. Do you think that Christmas belongs to you? Christmas doesn't belong to Santa, to the Kings, or to any of you. It belongs to all the boys and girls in the world. We are the protagonists. Where are you going, Sandoval? How did you escape? Consider it a Christmas miracle. Oh, really? Betrayal? Well, well... What do you intend to do exactly? Talk to you before you make the biggest mistake of your life. That's your big plan?! Shut up, Krampus! Don't be so selfish. Not everything revolves around you, you know? We know you're in there, Ignacio. And you don't want to do away with Christmas. That's the last thing you'd want to do. Of course not, because you love Christmas more than anyone. Like when you were little. Every year, the whole family gathered at Christmas in your grandparents' house. Every year you and your brother set up the Nativity scene. Until your uncle Juan lit the chimney and you all sat and sang together: Go, go, go, it's a shindig... Go, go, go, it's Christmas Eve. And surely you remember that morning when you went to open your present. Without knowing how, your first bicycle appeared. The red BMX dirt bike. With white wheels. Do you really want to end all this forever? No. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to! I don't, no! But I do! And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to do away with Christmas. His Excellency, Mayor Ignacio Sandoval, has just come out. It seems he's going to say something. We hope it's good news. It's official! The Three Kings... will not hold the parade! Scoundrel! The Three Kings from the Orient have abandoned us as well. I'm too old for this. We're lost without our magic. It's Him. -It's us! -And we've brought help! -But we need you to distract him. -We need time. Christmas is over! Now I have all my power. You can't do anything to me now. Now no child will be safe from the clutches of the Krampus. You can't pass. What'll you do to stop it? When you open the blinds, a porcelain color... What's this about? ...marking the spot, is a sign that Christmas is here... If you look on a child receiving affection... Dude, dude, your turn. If it snows again, it's a sign that Christmas is here... Enough! Out, out! Sorry, little girl, sorry. Let's find them. Enough. Accept your defeat. Christmas is dead. If you hear carols from afar... And people walking and laughing... Everything... brings back memories It's because Christmas has come. I will have no mercy on you. If when you close the windows, the smell of hazelnuts spread throughout your home It's because Christmas has come. Christmas has come. Christmas... has come! Is this a joke or what? No! It's a distraction! Who are you? Ana Ruiz, trainee page. Sandoval. Sandoval. Sandoval. Friends, we've finally defeated the Krampus. At last! Great! What are you doing here? -I'm going to my office. -Yes, good idea. How pretty they are! Mayor, welcome. -Do you see something, do you see them? -No. Guys, this isn't over yet. We have to recover Christmas. They're waiting outside. Gosh, they're going to lynch us. Maybe, but this is about saving Christmas, and someone reminded us that the most important thing about Christmas is not us. Ana, dear, why don't you go out first and calm things down a little? Go on. -Me? -Yes, yes, you! Let's go, let's go. Here she comes, here she comes. It's Ana! Get outta here! Get outta here! Hello? Can you hear me? I suppose you're wondering... -Hit the road, you drag! -That's right! Get outta here! -As I was about to say... -Nobody cares! We want to see the Kings! If you'll let me finish, maybe... We want to see the Kings! We want to see the Kings! We want to see the Kings! We want to see the Kings! Forget it... With you tonight... The Three Kings! Merry Christmas! Please give a big hand for our great friend, Santa Claus! I don't believe it, it's your time! Enjoy! Santa, Santa, Santa! Santa, Santa, Santa! How are my people? Merry Christmas! Santa, Santa, Santa! NO ENTRY Well, my Kings, Christmas together has been a pleasure, but we have to split. Where are you going? What do you mean where? To deliver my presents. I can't let the boys and girls of the world go without Santa Claus' Christmas Day presents. Are we crazy or what? Santa, you are aware that today is the 5th? You relax. I'm going to do a little trick with the clock to turn back time. Are you aware of how dangerous that could be? The consequences could be catastrophic. We'd face a terrible paradox capable of causing a chain reaction that would alter the space-time continuum. No, no, no. It's a joke! I've never done it, ever. This will be the first time I've done it... again. But understand me, I can't let the kids get the crappy presents you give them. I'd never forgive myself. Well, make the most of it, Kings. Let's go, lil' guy, to work. See you later, you old fogies. Goodbye. Well... You have to love him the way he is, right? I don't know why, but I think this means trouble. Let's go! To the past, Elf 1!
