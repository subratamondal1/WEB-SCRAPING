Nikkatsu Corporation SLOPE IN THE SUN Original Story by Yojiro Ishizaka Produced by Seio Sakagami Directed by Tomotaka Tasaka Starring Yujiro Ishihara Mie Kitahara Izumi Ashikawa Tamio Kawaji Yuji Odaka Hisako Yamane Koreya Senda Isamu Kosugi Yukiko Todoroki TASHIRO Baron, Baron! Come here! Hello. Hey, listen. If you're selling pens and paper, ask the lady in the kitchen in the back. I sell nothing. I'm Takako Kuramoto, applying to tutor here. What? You are? Listen. You have to be bright, healthy... And I have one more condition. Any idea? No... It's this: you must be good-looking. What a thing to say! Hey... As for me... I have just one rule... Understand? What do you mean... one rule? It's basically simple. About touching your body a little. That's okay, no? I don't accept such a rule. Give it up. It's a rule. It's my rule. How insulting! I'm going back. Hey, wait. Hold it. Don't get angry about this. You can hit me if you want, but don't go back. Shinji, what's up? Who's your visitor? Ah, brother. This girl... ...she's applying for the job of Kumiko's tutor. But she says she wants to leave. It's your fault. Excuse me, I'll be right down. My brother is way more of a gentleman than me. And he does not have rules like me. You can trust him. I'm sorry if my brother was rude to you. Please come in. My mother and sister are waiting. Welcome. I'm Mr. Tashiro's wife. My name is Midori. Nice to meet you. Kumiko, please introduce yourself. I am Kumiko Tashiro. Tutor, you will notice that I walk with a limp. I may act a little spoiled, but please don't mind me. But I don't care if people talk about bad legs in front of me. Now, now, Kumiko. She talks first about things that bother her most. As a child, when she was playing she got hurt. But if you don't look carefully, you hardly notice it. Well, please sit down. Ah, if you don't mind... Kumiko! Tutor, that's a chair made abroad... ...but the springs being too hard, we never use it for guests. Whose idea was this? It was Shinji's idea. He wanted my next tutor to sit in it. And I agreed. I'm sorry, tutor. He is hopeless. Miss Kuramoto, when Shinji or Kumiko like someone they're in the habit of teasing them. And you always try to explain things, but have no opinion yourself. Look who's talking! If you were a little more thoughtful, ...instead of your limp, you could have told her... ...that you swim the 400m at school. Then she wouldn't feel so embarrassed. And because I am lame - they have prepared a huge dowry for me. Kumiko, not in front of a guest. Did you wash your hands? Shinji, where are you going? I'll eat here by myself. I can't compete with my brother. Say, I feel insulted. Do as you like. Miss Kuramoto, you must be from the North, no? Yes, from Hirosaki. - Hirosaki, that's in Aomori, right? - Yes. Our gymnastics teacher is from Aomori. He has such a queer dialect. Like... "Everyone, put on your short pants and gather in front of the iron bar." And tells funny things about Aomori like "We have rare birds like crows and sparrows." And miss Kuramoto, have you been working through college the whole time? No, this will be the first time. My family can pay for my studies, so that is no problem... ...but if I want to buy extra books... ...I soon use up my allowance. So I have to work part-time. We asked for a tutor, but you will not so much be teaching Kumiko. She is clever enough... But we need someone she can talk with. Who can teach her about life. Then maybe I had better leave. I do not have the qualifications to teach her about life. And I do not want to be a preacher. Well... we don't want a preacher. I have to go out alone sometimes, right. So if you just come with me to plays or performances, it's enough. It's all right to just eat and chat with her. Tutor, won't you take a look at my room? Sure, I'll have a look. Mama, could we have some tea and sweets in my room? All right. New acquaintances always look at my legs. I'm sorry. I'm used to it, so I don't care. Is this you, Kumiko? My brother Shinji drew it. He said it's my deformed mentality. That face looks like this. How mean to paint you like this. But I like it. Shinji and I don't belong in this house. Somehow we always seem to do the wrong thing. But Yukichi is quite the opposite. He is mother's favorite. Because he is so perfect, we look so inferior. My brother Yukichi is so kind and considerate - and so handsome. I'd say - his fault is not having faults. What does he study? He is a medical intern. Quite an attractive man. Yes, he really is. The nurses all talk about him. My friends are crazy about him. And yet he is not engaged nor does he have any girlfriends. Perhaps girls look like fools to him. Then he might think I am foolish too? Oops... I'm sorry. I didn't realize praising him would be insulting you. I'm really sorry. Mama keeps telling me... ...when I first meet people, I talk as if I've known them 5 or 10 years. On the other hand, what people say is all the same to me. Really? It's true. Then I'll ask something... ...only an old friend would ask you, Kumiko, how - did your legs get injured? No... I can't! I'm sorry. But I was anxious to know. I'm not angry. But I just can't. Someday in the bath I'll show it to you. This bone is a bit twisted. So... But you're bright, right... Your mother? My brother Yukichi. He is good. I wonder. I have no inspiration at all. Just boring. Auntie! Oh, it's you, Miss Kuramoto. You just came back? Yes. Welcome back. Been shopping? A big box was delivered. A box of apples. From home. Father claims there are no better apples than from Aomori. Yes, I'll agree with him. Because it's a local product. I'll ask Tamio to bring you the box. Thank you. Won't you come in for some tea? Thanks. Ah, come to think of it, I've never seen your room. That's right, so you should. I'll go and tell Tamio first. Oh, Tama. Where have you been? Tamio, could you take this box of apples to Miss Kuramoto's room? I'll be in her room. OK. What a nice, clean room you have. Ah, I prepared a pillow to sit on. Eh? You really shouldn't do that. It's bad karma, showing your shoes. But I just bought them. I want to admire them. They're a decoration. There. Thank you. Mr. Tamio was singing just now, right? Poor him. He really wants to be a composer. But that does not make any money, so... ...he sings American songs, which seem to be popular in night clubs. Oh, I see. I don't get it at all. That would be Jazz, right? But he earns money with it and takes good care of me. So, although at my age I just work in a restaurant, I'm really happy. Working in a restaurant is difficult. isn't it? In a way. But when I was young, I was a Geisha, so I don't mind it. Oh, thank you. Mum, gossiping again? No, she was telling me what a good son you are. Ah, that again. He feels embarrassed. Where is the hammer? It's OK, I'll open it myself. Such things are meant for men. That's the proper way. You already told me so. Sorry about that. I will treat Tamio to dinner when I get paid. Are you working? Starting today I'm a tutor. You know Asia Books? The President asked me... The President of Asia Books? Oh aunty, do you know him? Not at all. Why should somebody like me know Mr. Tashiro... Miss Kuramoto, there will be a party tonight. So I must be at work early, and I must prepare Tamio's dinner. Tamio, be careful not to damage the apples when you open the crate. I'll bring some apples later. Thank you. Sis, it's OK to talk to my mother but don't gossip too much. Women like that, don't they... We can't be helped... When Mother sees you, she talks her head off. You should not say that about your mother. It's my mother, I can say what I like. She's like a bit sour sometimes. Well, I never... Say, Sis... What? Is it OK to visit you next time? OK. But when I first met you I thought you were bad company. If you agree with that, then please don't bother. If not, then come. I am surprised. This is the first time I've been called bad company. But I don't mind. Really? But I think I am fine, so I'll drop by. Is that OK, Sis? OK. But stop calling me "Sis," I have a name. Sure. I should say "Miss Kuramoto," right? I don't like it, though. Miss Kuramoto, this is for you. Bye now. Welcome back. Is Midori at home? Everybody went to a concert, but Mr. Shinji is in his room. Evening, Papa. Why the noise? If mother were... I knew she's not home, so... I'd like to drink your whiskey, Papa. Run when she returns, quickly flee to your room! Why didn't you go too? You like music. Yes, I do. But I hate formality. What if I sneezed? Or did something wrong? So she went with Miss Kuramoto instead. Say Papa, what do you think of Miss Kuramoto? She's nice. Kumiko likes her. Papa, the more I like and respect a person - the more I want to be disliked by him. Otherwise I won't feel safe. Papa, do you understand such feelings? No. Can't you be more youthfully cheerful? Cheerful? Nonsense. Is your life cheerful? Life is not all that easy... When Miss Kuramoto first came here I liked her very much. So I wanted her to dislike me. What do you think I did? I don't know. Did you insult her? Not as such. I pointed at her forehead, and touched her breast. My rule! Shinji! What a disgraceful thing to do. Against our honour! You talk of honour? Please... What would your mother say if she knew? It might make her happy to know that I'm a no good delinquent. Shinji, what's the matter with you tonight? Go to bed. I don't want to. I want to talk with you some more. Papa, the woman who gave birth to me... Is she still alive? Did you say something? I did, Papa. I asked if the woman who gave birth to me is still alive. Shinji! You kn...? Yes, Papa. I know. So you knew all about it. I thought that some day I should tell you about it. But mother was against it. I wonder why. Mother thinks you don't know anything. She is confident she has brought you up like her own child. The old bag! What did you say? The old bag! Idiot! You insult mother! After all she has done for you. I'm sorry to have insulted your wife. I apologize. Mother was most considerate toward you. That's it. Her being too considerate was what made me suspicious. Not when we were alone, but... ...when other people were around. And you too. What did I do? Papa and Mama are the opposite of each other. You are kind when we are together, but cold when others are around. Among the three of us, only I was treated that way. It made me think. Right Papa? Were you - thinking like that? Papa, you don't have to worry. No matter how I was born I'm satisfied with life. As long as I live, I can paint. There's music to listen to... There's God to pray to... There's alcohol to drink... There's you to talk to... The dog to play with... There's no end to it!! Indeed living is nice, Papa! But Shinji, I beg of you. Don't give mother a hard time. Because she believes you think she is your real mother. Don't be silly. Are you lying because you have been drinking? Mother realizes I know the truth. And you know that she knows it. Why can't you be frank when we're alone? You're living - within a castle made up of lies. Isn't it stifling? What do you want me to do? Nothing at all. I just want to know. I want to ask you my first question. Is my real mother still living? I don't know, I really don't know. Tell me about her. She was an open-hearted and good woman. Her name was Some-roku, and she was a Geisha. Was she handsome? Look at your own face in the mirror. You resemble her. Say, Papa, did you love her? You were born between us. Children can be had with violence too. What? Was it with money... that you bought her love? I am right, no? Shinji! You insist on a reply no matter what? Yes, Papa, I want to know. Well then... my reply is this. Papa, I won't hit back. So you can put the bottle down. You're old fashioned. Why get so excited? A man gets bored at home and has an affair with a geisha. That's all, right? So Papa, please be calm and sit down. I'm sorry I hit you. Papa, listen to me. I'm glad you hit me. It showed courage. Neither you nor Mama show your emotions toward me. They go past me to my brother and Kumiko. So that's what I wanted. Thanks. Listen! Mama has returned. Don't show any excitement. Be calm. You were sipping whiskey and reading a book. Be calm. Welcome home. Any call from Tomiko? No. Darling, I'm home. How was it? The concert. It was really wonderful. Hello, Papa. (A song of a drunkard) Too bad. He is drunk. I'm going up to lecture him. He's trying to spite us. It's just like him. Tell him that song is a disgrace. I'll tell him to sing the hymns that Mama likes. Were you drinking together with Shinji? No, I was reading this book. This book? I never knew you liked cooking. I just picked up anything at hand. You can't read without glasses. You're in a bad mood. I'm not. I'm taking a bath. Read your cookbook. Where's brother? Bringing Miss Kuramoto home. Getting in the mood with music and taking a walk in town... It's nice. As long as you sing songs like that, she won't go out with you. What? After the concert we had dinner at a restaurant in Ginza. I was not hungry so I couldn't finish my beefsteak. Mrs, may I finish her plate? I'm so hungry. Yes, please help yourself. She finished it? Yes. I come to like her more and more. Shinji, were you drinking with Papa? Yes, but if Mama asks you, please say no. You had this talk with Papa? Kumiko, even you already knew I'm not Mama's real son. Everybody knew it and pretended not to... And is your real mother still living? He said he really doesn't know. Would you like to meet her? Yes, if she is alive. But I want just to know the truth. I'm not worried that she might be dead. I don't mind what kind of person she is. She is still my mother. She must be pretty, because Papa went astray... When I asked Papa, he told me to look in the mirror. Then... Then she wouldn't be, right? No, I mean she must have looked pretty to someone who loved her. But had a funny face to anyone else. You made a very smart remark. What else did you talk about? He hit me. What a thing to do! Thinking about it, Papa is unfortunate. He was left with me, a symbol of his unfortunate past. Don't insult my Mama, please. I'm sure - that Mama appreciates many of your good qualities. Don't dislike her. I don't. But I'm not grateful either. Shinji, what do you intend to do from now? I'm going to make it clear with Mama. Then with my brother. But what for? I don't know. But this household is made up of lies. I'll smash them. You talk about lies. But if you go on peeling an onion, in the end there's nothing left. In order to keep a large household together, lies are often necessary. Cement has to have sand. When did you become a sophist? Even I can observe things. But as the situation stands now, we must unite by acknowledging the truth. So, brother, although I'm Mama's child, do you love me? Yes. I was the one who caused your everlasting injury. But I never felt the need to apologize. It feels as if I'd injured my own elbow. Terrible! But strangely even now I can't get angry. Because you are my brother. My! You reek of liquor. When I marry... I wonder if I could ever love a man who smells of alcohol. It sounds strange, somehow. - Good night, brother. - Good night. I'm happy to have confirmed we really feel like brother and sister. Confirmed again, right! Miss Takako, don't you like alcohol? No, no. Ah, I am relieved. Here's to becoming good friends! Please. Alcohol is quite different from juice. Maybe it's not for you. It's OK, I want to experience how it feels to be drunk. Are you OK? Sure, I'm OK, since I'm with you. You trust me like that? Ah, let me light it. I just got this but haven't had a chance to use it. Is working at our place not too hard? Because Mama and Kumiko both have nasty habits. No problem, since I also state clearly what I want to say. Mama is very happy. She says that since you came she got quite cheerful. She makes too much of it. Kumiko and me sometimes skip study... We talk about men, love and how bad capitalism is. Your mother might be disgusted. No, no. You act a bit strange sometimes, but every rose has its thorn. Takako, your eyes got a bit red. It's no good, my face. Don't look too much at me, please. Somehow I don't seem to get this part right. It's enough for now. Think about the neighbours. I want to compose a good song quickly. Mother, don't you think I just look like an average man? Or maybe a tiny bit better. Not just average. I attentively gave birth to you. If you grow up a bit, you'll be more like a man. Is that so? But it's meaningless when your family praises you. However, I have not once been rejected by a woman. But you're absent-minded. You wouldn't notice if a woman fell in love with you. Perhaps it's better like that... You like playing with women? That might be so, but there's nobody right now. I need to study in order to make a living. Ah, that's better. Auntie, I'm back. Welcome! Miss Kuramoto, please come in. No, no. I drank a bit to much, so my face is a bit messy. I'm not hungry and I won't have supper. Good night! That so? - Well, good night. - Good night, Sis. Sorry... Did you have to wait? I just came. You asked your mother? No, no. I told her we're going to a movie. I see. Well, as your tutor, I shall consider a movie about the same as jazz. My favorite singer is Jimmy Koike. He's a Handsome Boy. I wanted you to see him at least once. Is jazz something to look at? You're right. I wanted you to hear him... It's over there, tutor. It has been quite a while... Did Non-chan come here? Non-chan was here the day before yesterday. What is Jimmy singing today? "Seven o'clock". If you like I can introduce you to him later. No thanks. I'd rather watch from a distance. But he's a wonderful fellow. Your order? Coffee and cake. Make it a good one. Yes, at your service. He remembers your face. I had quite a different idea of these places. But there are young people and a healthy atmosphere. Is this a place to meet a boyfriends? We wouldn't think of it. It's just for music. And now we take pleasure in presenting Jimmy Koike. He will sing "7 O'Clock". I bet you were surprised. I was astonished when I saw you. And Kumiko was surprised when you waved. If I knew Jimmy was an acquaintance I would not have acted so enthusiastic. But why are you Jimmy Koike? It's my stage name. My friends called me Jimmy. Koike is my father's name. But you knew very well we were there. From the stage you can see really well. And I like Miss Tashiro for some time. Because her way of walking is a bit strange? Totally not. From the stage, her eyes sparkle. She's really impressive. To think Miss Tashiro was Sis' pupil... Hey! Stop calling me "Sis" in front of people. It sounds funny. Especially housemaids and such really hate that. But you're close friends, it sounds nice. I'll go phone your mother that we will be eating out. OK. Yes. Of course it is all right. Thank you for taking the trouble. Our cat's name is Kuro, and every night she goes to sleep with Baron. Baron is our Great Dane, and 20 to 30 times bigger. Baron sleeps with his legs stretched out like this. And Kuro sleeps curled up between them. What a dog. Baron eats out of wash basin this big. But when he starts, Kuro objects... Baron has to wait his turn. Kuro gets right into the basin to eat. And Baron just waits, circling around it. How funny. Instead of a dog, we have a cat in our apartment. Her name is Tama, and she sleeps with mother or me. Do you know how she decides with whom to sleep? I have no idea... I found out that she chooses the one that smells of alcohol. It took me 6 months to find out. So one day I offered her a bowl of rice wine. She lapped it up like water and then began to totter. She couldn't keep her eyes open. Under mothers' influence, Kuro would sing hymns. Hymns! So we part here. I wish you would visit her apartment. Then you could visit me too. If Miss Kuramoto says it's OK to come. I haven't visited her once. I really look like I'm pestering her like an old lady. Goodbye. So long. Miss Kumiko phoned to say that there's a class meeting and she would be about an hour late. I see. I'll take a walk in the garden. And Mrs. Tashiro? She went to a celebration at a relative's house. I see. Baron, don't bark. Don't bark. Baron, you're hopeless. It's rare that people feel so free. Hello. Why are you sitting in there? Away from humans. It's dirty. Are humans so clean? Won't you step into my living room? It's nice. Quite a different atmosphere. Won't that dog bite? It's OK. As long as you're no threat to me, he is friendly. Baron, down! Come in. Sorry for disturbing. Studying paintings? Don't you like paintings? I like looking at them, but that's all. I'll paint you. I don't like to be stared at. Say, Miss Kuramoto, do you know that painters... ...can visualize the nude of a woman they like? Would you get angry? You can imagine anything, but saying so is rude. The truth is often rude. I'll be rude once more. You were caressing the lawn. And your bare feet were dancing over it. I enjoyed watching you. And I thought: "Now she wants to caress the lawn, warmed by the sun." "Soon she surely will want to caress a young man." What are you saying? If you keep saying such rude things... ...I never want to speak to you again. Is it so rude to state the fact that men and women fall in love? That... That may be so, but I would like you to keep your thoughts to yourself. Women will get angry if you say things like this. But I wouldn't say it to just anybody. Only to someone who understands. Won't you marry me? Thanks, Miss Kuramoto. - Now listen... - No. This time it's about myself. I'm not a real child of Mama here. I'm the son of a Geisha. Her name was Some-roku. Do you know her? No. You mustn't! Let me go! You know something I don't. I don't know anything. Hold the dog! He reads my emotions. Tell me. I'll tell you, so hold the dog. When I get out of here I will marry you. So talk. Your mother is in my apartment. - What's her name? - Tomiko Takagi. What kind of a woman is she? She's very nice. What does she do? She is a maid in a restaurant. Is she poor? Her 18 year old son is working too, so they are not poor. You're friends? We are. Did you know this before? It dawned upon me when you mentioned Some-roku. I see. Thanks. I shall never speak to you again. I object. What you told me will help everyone. That's the way I feel. So don't feel guilty. - I'll never... - Speak to me? May I come in? It's me, Takako. Come in. What's the noise? It's a method of expressing my emotions. "Miss Kuramoto from downstairs, please come upstairs." "Just like this? "Just like this?" That's the noise. That is not why I came up. There's something I want to tell you. What's that? I thought it over and I'm not mad at you. So I won't finish with you yet. It's because you think I'm an a kind of fool. At least you've often thought so. I'm sorry. How did you know? Because you always forgive me. How long do you intend to stand there? You scared of me? I'm not scared. That cat dislikes women. Just like Yukichi... So, miss Kuramoto, please introduce me someday to my mother and brother. I don't think I should interfere in other people's family affairs. Let sleeping dogs lie. I'll visit them when I feel like it. That's me, no? I didn't capture you very well. Please stay where you are. If you come closer you might cause some trouble. How silly. It's not a nude, I'm glad... I've never wanted to be painted. I don't mind if you destroy it. May I have it? Sure. Thanks. Different horn. I thought it was the old bag. When she's so nice. Me, when I'm in a bad mood - I call her bad names everywhere, even at school or on the train. Ever since I was a child I've been calling her names. But she does not mind. Mama has quite a brave character. She continues to hold her grip over us all. And has brought me up all these years as her own child. The old bag! Saying these things is mean to your brother and sister. I'll say anything in front of Kumiko. She looks like she agrees with me. But Miss Kuramoto, besides her, what do you think of my younger brother? Tamio? He's nice to his mother and he's a good singer. I think, compared with you, he is more serious. Probably because he lives with his mother. You're very clever! In a short time you found all my weaknesses. You sound like a professor praising his student. To me, you're an elementary schoolgirl with somewhat round breasts. I heard Tamio sing once, but he really wants to study composition. Composition! Why would he choose such an unprofitable line of work? Just like you, studying painting and making no money. I already said you're smart. What should I say next? Why don't you say next that I'm an exceptional beauty? I'm going. - Don't come close. - I won't. Ah... the warmth of your hips is still here. - Bye. - Bye. Are you going home already? Yes, because your mother and Miss Kumiko are not at home. It's a pity. I hurried back to see you. Won't you take a walk with me? All right. It's such a nice warm day. Where shall we go? Ah! Let's buy and eat baked potato. I love them more than rice. Next holiday Kumiko is going to your home? Yes, I promised to teach her to ski. I might follow you. On skis, you can't beat me. I'm a bit worried. Will Kumiko be able to ski? If she's not hindered, her skiing causes no trouble. She said this once... ...if everyone had to wear skis, no one would notice her limp. It doesn't worry her anymore. Please come under the coat. Otherwise it's too cold. Don't you want to eat it? No, just looking at it is enough for me. I peeled this one for you. Do you think it's too "bourgeois" for your stomach? It's not that... ...truth is that I'm attracted to someone who likes potatoes more than rice... Well then, goodbye. It was fun. It was the first time someone else than my mother peeled a potato for me. Goodbye. Tamio, Happy New Year. Please take care of me this year again. Yes. Happy New Year. Say, Tamio... Being just the two of us this New Year's morning... ...is a bit lonely, so may I take out your father's picture? Why not, mother. He was your husband after all. Happy New Year. Tamio, why don't you pay your respects too? I don't like that. I'll do it when it suits me. He did some terrible things, so why should I pray? You may feel that way, but I can never forget him. You mean because I was born? I don't mean that, Tamio. I mean he was the only man who took me seriously. I know he treated me terribly. But he was earnest. He beat and kicked me. I really suffered. But when he died everything faded away. Except that he took me seriously. Remember Tamio, if a man is earnest, that is what counts. Like I would understand! To love a drunkard... You'll get a wife someday, and if you really love her, there's no harm in hitting her sometimes. That's no joke! I have had enough. If I come to like a modern woman, with too strong a spirit, I will do the leaving. Let her beat you, as long as she is serious and truly loves you. If she feels like that, it can't be helped. I for one won't hit women. Say, mother. About that brother I have, I won't accept him, but... ...was his father serious? Oh no! Cultured people lack seriousness. They value appearance. But I do hope someday to have the opportunity, to thank the lady who fostered your brother. How touching. You can thank her as you please. But I won't recognise him as my brother. But Tamio... Isn't it lonesome to have no relatives or friends we can depend upon? I don't care for myself, my years are limited. But you have a future ahead of you. Don't make such a face. Your fathers may be different, but he's your only brother. He is the only other human being that was born from the same mother as you. Not to accept him is going against the will of God. God or no God. It's useless. Mother, I don't need a brother. Even if we should accept each other, like you want... ...he'd be proud and insolent. And I'd feel small and miserable. I'll be independent. Don't worry about me. You bore him, so if you want to see your son, that's up to you. Just leave me alone. You're unkind. You won't understand how I feel. But you started all this. Please don't cry, mother. I won't always be alone. I'll find a nice girl and get married. Then I won't be alone anymore. And with grand children around, your life will be busy. I've been thinking about it. My wife has to be kinder to you than to me. So I always tell myself, "Tamio, don't get fooled by the appearance of a girl." You are a real son to me. I'm so happy. Tomiko! Mrs. Tomiko! We invited her to go to the shrine! Your mother should be ready, no? Yes! Mother, they're waiting for you. Tell them I'm coming. She's coming. They're all nice friends of mine. Go down and greet them. Sorry to keep you waiting. Tamio, sorry to borrow your mother. Happy New Year. We are listening to the snow falling softly. I am writing this by a warm stove. We went skiing yesterday and today. Miss Kumiko's bold skiing kept me in suspense. Every time we fell into the snow, and came crawling out, we would laugh and laugh at each other. And then we would talk about how we could push that dandified Tamio-san into the snow. Best wishes to mother. Takako. Happy New Year. Kumiko. It's a Happy New Year. Is this Mrs. Takagi's room? That's right. Is she in? She's gone out. But your name is also Takagi, right? I'm her son. You sing, don't you? I've heard your songs. To be frank, you lack style and you're only imitating. How rude! And who would you be? My name is Shinji Tashiro. I am your brother. And I am also the brother of Kumiko Tashiro. Haven't you heard my name? I... don't know such a name. What's the idea coming here? Want to throw your weight around? Please leave. You're touchy. Tell your mother that Shinji Tashiro came to see her. KURAMOTO TAKAKO Good evening. You're a friend of Tamio, right? Tamio is out now, but come right in. We're having a New Year's party. Just old people, but won't you join us? Come on in, young man. The only males here are those two old cranks. What are you... You're just in time. Let's have a drink. Be nice to him because he's a friend of Tamio. You a musician too? I'm a painter. You're a painter! I really love paintings. That new painting of Mt. Fuji at the bath house. Wonderful. The painter is a customer of mine. How about... Say, don't you think so? I gave her a life of luxury. I took her to the theatre, to hot springs. She made the restaurant I inherited ... ... from my father go bankrupt. And that bitch - she draws every cent I've got, and takes off with a young punk. And here I am working as a cook for a living. Hear me. Never again will I believe a woman. Those creatures called women are worse than beasts. There he goes again. All men and women in this room, have been the victim of cheating. We were all trampled on and victimized, but it's good to be alive. I'm sorry, I am ashamed to be a man. I'm really sorry. Don't fuss, let's sing, dance and be merry. Mrs. Oyone, please play the shamisen. Come, let's dance. I'll play Mamurogawa, OK? {\i1\an8}Washa Mamurogawa no ume no hana koorya I am the plum flower of Mamurogawa {\i1\an8}anata mata kono machi no uguisu yo And you are the nightingale of this town I'll dance too. {\i1\an8}hana no saku no o machi-kanete koorya You could not await my blooming {\i1\an8}tsubomi no uchi kara kayotte kuru You went back and forth around my bud {\i1\an8}yume wo mita (3x) I was in a dream (3x) {\i1\an8}anata to sou toko yume ni mita There I saw you in my dreams {\i1\an8}san kudo no sakazuki o koorya I drank three, nay, nine cups of sake {\i1\an8}itadaku tokoro de me ga sameta And I woke up where I was drinking Hey, get out! (leafing through New Year's cards) I am back Mama. Good night. Shinji, let me see your face. I had some drinks, Mama. It's New Year's, so that's OK. If you like, you can have some of Papa's drinks. No thanks. I have had enough. Where's Papa? Out golfing. An empty home on New Year's. I was meeting some people myself. Don't be so tight. We just had a phone call from Mr. Hirosaki. He said Yukichi sprained his ankle while skiing and went to the hospital with Miss Kuramoto. But there is no need to worry. So Miss Kuramoto is taking care of him? That'll go well... How so, after you've been alone so long? Say Shinji... ...everybody is away tonight. Only you and me are at home. Recently we didn't have a chance to talk together. Let's have a little chat. There're some things we need to tell each other. OK, Mama. Let's be frank. I know you can. Have you already met with your birth mother? So you have indeed. Mama, I met her today. But I did not tell her. Today? And what did you think? Do you intend to leave this house and live with her? No, I want to stay here together with you. Because I belong in this family. I wish the same. If you should leave us now... ...our Tashiro household will go to pieces. Shinji, please look me straight in the eyes. I am, Mama. I don't clearly know whether I love you or not. But I do know you are a person with backbone. Whether I am glad you are that kind of person or not, I really don't know. Surely you're happy, because you're broad-minded. No flattering, please. I've often heard you calling me an "old bag". Mama, that's true, I surely have. But it's only because I admire your backbone. You talk exactly like me. Let's respect each other's opinions. And is there anything you wanted to ask me? Why did you adopt me, Mama? Any idea yourself? I'll tell you. You wanted me to always be beside Papa as a lasting symbol of his mistake. Such a mean interpretation can be true, but it's often wrong. But I won't deny it. However... If God asked me why I adopted Shinji, I would face Him and reply: "Shinji was born under adverse circumstances," "but I did not want him to suffer." Then did you love me? Yes, probably... Love is not something present from the start. It has to grow. I think I know you better than anyone else. Maybe because of all the hardships. Shall I prove with one example how well I know you? It's this: You keep silent about a certain accident. I'll be blunt. It was not you who injured Kumiko, it was Yukichi. You're wrong, Mama. I did it, it was me. I did something wrong. We are quite alone now. No need to put on an act. But Mama, it really was my fault. My brother and Kumiko know it. I did it, I tell you! In the beginning, you resented being falsely accused. But later you felt you were obligating us by... ... letting us believe you were responsible. Whenever you talk about how you injured Kumiko, you must feel a certain sense of superiority. But only I knew the way you truly felt. I always wanted to talk to you about this one day. I want you to know that you have not obligated me in any way. I... I did it. You're wrong. That day I called Yukichi to my room. I asked him how you were playing when Kumiko got injured. I said I would not give him away, and asked for the truth. You had brought out a long ladder and were playing circus. Kumiko, climb higher. Yukichi, it's dangerous! Better let her down. You weakling! Shinji, don't let go. Kumiko, you're safe. I've just climbed up. It's quite high. I can see harbor, it's so pretty. Just then a butterfly fluttered close. I gathered insects so I wanted to catch it. Shinji, don't. It's you. Shinji, it's you. Shinji, it's your fault. Right? My back hurts! Yukichi told me... ...it was you who wanted to catch the butterfly and had let go of the ladder. Then I immediately knew it was not you, but Yukichi who had let go. That's... No, Shinji. I know the character of the child I bore better than anyone else. I instinctively knew he was lying. You may wonder... ...why I didn't make Yukichi tell the truth. The reasons are complicated indeed. Firstly, I didn't want to hurt Yukichi's pride. I blindly loved my child. The reason for my blindness... ... was because I saw... he was very intelligent, but lacked a sense of morals. This constantly worried me. And secondly,... to admit that he was not my child, but Papa's son with a Geisha was b... I'm sorry, Shinji. It was thoughtless of me. To tell Papa that my son had injured her... I couldn't bear to lose his respect. Shinji, you must think I am a very coldhearted woman. I don't, Mama. Because it was I who did it. Even Kumiko knows. When the ladder started to fall, she said "Shinji, no!" She saw me let go. Kumiko called your name instinctively. She knew in a time of emergency, you were more dependable than Yukichi. Me, me! It was me! Anyway, regarding Kumiko's problem, both you and Yukichi are liars. But when I compare your lies, I feel ashamed being Yukichi's mother. Though you pretend to have done wrong, Yukichi is receiving the biggest penalty. His conscience hurts him every time the subject is mentioned. Particularly,... ... he has an inferiority complex toward you. Therefore, try as he may, morally, he is doomed. No wonder. He started with a falsity. And he sees that every day in the form of Kumiko's limp. I fear someday he may do something terrible. Shinji. Do you have the heart to protect Yukichi? I do. But I have my own reasons to do it. I will believe you. I feel much lighter having said this. Because you cannot sneer at us any more concerning Kumiko. Shinji, come over here and show me your face once more. So what are your intentions with Tomiko Takagi? When I met her, I thought she was quite rigid. She seemed to want relationships. She seems to have a son called Tamio from a different father. He seems to be a jazz-singer. Quite a strange fellow. It would be nice to meet him. It's OK to do as you think. It's gotten late, let's end with a truce. So this was our New Year's Day's evening. It's OK, Mama, Anyway I will always see you as my mother. Good night. Good night. You're back? What, are you still awake? Sorry we kind of shut you out today. It was probably quite lively, no? Yes, it was interesting and everybody had great fun. I treated them to rice cakes. It cost some money but everybody was happy. They said I must be happy because my son earns money. I felt so good... A good feeling... But at quite an expense. Often the same with me too. I don't like it. But Tamio, it's good to be able to make others happy. Did you have dinner? Yes, and I had a few drinks. Ah, with your painter friend? What's his name? What was it again... I only call him by his nickname. But he's a strange fellow. He danced and sang with us. He was a very nice fellow. I like his type very much. But he plays pachinko and teases the girls working there. And he's rough. Is Tama with you? No, not here. Where could she be? Tama is probably also having some New Year's party. A New Year's party, sure... But even so... Mother, it's snowing. Is it? Yes? A telegram. Such a stupid fellow! "Brother, don't get a sunburn. Shinji" It proves Shinji wants you to return quickly. Mr. Tashiro can go home pretty soon. The doctor said "The patient can run like a short track runner." That's no joke. With this telegram from Shinji, I suddenly want to go back to Tokyo. That is, you could go back together with Kumiko. So you would leave me alone with my leg, like I was a burden. Were you thinking that? Not at all. Then are you glad? No. Well, let me show you something interesting. Please get my crutches. Look carefully now. That is very mean! Sure, I kept silent. Because I wanted to befriend you. I don't mind having done a bad thing. I wanted to get to know you. Do you disagree with me lying? It's not disagreeable, right? Takako, I loved you from the beginning. And do you love me? I'm going home. I am not angry. I am really very happy. You love me, don't you? Yes. Takako, won't you marry me? Please agree to marry me. I'm home. Hey Sis. You took your time coming back. I've been using your room. You're welcome. Thanks for taking care of it. Auntie kept it nice and clean. And decorated with flowers too. Yes, I bought those. It's strange... You look prettier than when you left. Can you notice if a woman gets prettier? Well, I'm surprised at you. If I've grown any prettier, it's due to my home town's white snow and good food. When I say prettier, I mean you've grown sexier. Don't tell me snow and food makes a girl sexier. Is aunty well? Yes, she is in her room. I'm going back. But I am boiling water. If you want me to stay, I'll go back a bit later. I've brought a little gift and I'll pour some tea. But first, I want to change to working clothes, so Tamio, turn around and close your eyes. Ah, the closet is nice and clean too. Mother arranged it and also washed your underwear. I don't like it. Who opened my closet? It was me. I was curious how the inside of a girl's closet looks. Your smell was very distinct. It made me miss you. You're terrible. I should ask you to leave. But it's OK, though. Don't be stingy with your smell. I was just sniffing, nothing that harms you. That's true but... You know the time I first saw you... I felt, "this girl will do." What does that mean, "will do"? It means that you'll understand. You're modest, you're kind and a little mean. When and how was I a little mean, I wonder? Is it OK now? Oh, I forgot. Yes, it's OK. What did yo want to ask me? Is it about Kumiko? It's a bit related... Shinji Tashiro came. Did he come alone? Yes, he made a fool out of me. He pretended to be my friend and was singing with everybody. That sounds just like what Shinji would do. What did they sing? It was "Mamurogawa ondo". "I am the plum flower of Mamurogawa..." That one, right? So I was about to drag the guy out and throw some stones at him. But he bundled off. He? You mean Shinji ran away? Yeah, and if he comes back, he's going to get some more, that hoodlum. You say you will, but he's your brother, born from the same mother. I won't think about him as my brother. And aunty doesn't know anything yet about this? She doesn't know. Why don't you tell her? Because I think she'll cry and make a big fuss. She would cry because she'd be happy. Come to think of it, it's strange. Shinji is the brother of both you and Kumiko. Does Kumiko know? What do you mean? That we have the same brother. Of course she doesn't know yet. To Kumiko, you are only Mr. Koike. What would she do if I told her? I see! So that's what you wanted to know most. Not exactly, but... But I am worried. If she finds out, won't she avoid me? When I heard she was his sister, I was so surprised and had enough of him. Of course, Kumiko will be astonished. But later she will realize... ...that you are not related by blood... ...and that you can get married. I didn't mean it that way, really! I just thought it better that she knew about it. You don't want to lie when you go out with her. That's it. My conscience won't permit it. The point is when and how should she know. Someone has to talk to her. There's no other way, right? Don't talk in riddles. You want me to tell her, right? Yes. Maybe I should not have told you... That's not it. Tutor, was Jimmy very worried? Tamio was worried that once you knew, you would dislike him. He was concerned about that. He thinks the same thing as me. I wish I could meet Jimmy right now. I wanted to thank you for taking care of me. No, no. Has your ankle completely healed? Yes, like you say. I'll go and change. Tutor, did you become close friends with Yukichi? Yes, because I went to see him at the hospital every day. Everyone seems to fall for my brother Yukichi. Please come in. Say, Miss Kuramoto... ...please have dinner with us tonight. The Tashiros want to express their thanks. Thank you very much. It's rare that the whole family is here today. Oh, will Shinji also be there tonight? Yes, he promised me. He is not someone to break a promise. If you finished studying, how about taking a walk? Tutor, let's go. When can talk while we take a walk. What do you want to talk about? I would like to know too. It's a serious story. I cannot talk about it to you yet. I see, it's a secret. Mama is a bit strange... It's so warm here... Yukichi came back, right? If Shinji comes back we'll be all gathered for once. That's right. They're always travelling without telling where. About Shinji, he said he met Tagaki Tomoko on New Year's. He told me everything. I see. So he finally met her. He said something to you also, right? Some time before, he wanted to know something he was uneasy about. He was quite angry, I was at a loss. I wanted to tell you but I had no chance yet. I am sorry. Even without telling, I already understood. You were never any good at making excuses. I seem to lose to both you and my son. But this way it's peaceful. You think it's OK if it's peaceful. But you seem to be hurting Yukichi and Kumiko a bit. Because of that our home is always in turmoil. This is the best one of your recent works. The composition is good, and your touch is not rough the way it used to be. Thank you, Mama. I think so too. Congratulations on your good work. I know you wouldn't flatter me. Kiri, bring us some tea. Pretty colors. I'll lend it to you to look at it every day. That dull head of yours may discover what I call beauty. So I'm dull! Sure. For example, you think my brother is handsome. Those good looks are for teenagers. Forgive me for not thinking you look better. From the point of view of a painter, my looks are far superior. Shinji, come here. It seems Papa has something to say to all of us. Shall I leave the room? No, please remain. Because you are like family, Miss Kuramoto. This is not really new to you. I'm sure you already knew about it, but... ...the time has come for me to lay before you the facts... so you may judge for yourselves,... ...that's what I decided after consulting your mother... You may be aware by now of what I am going to say, but it's about Shinji. To put it plainly, Shinji was not born between me and your Mama. He was born between me and another woman. I am ashamed to have to confess this fact to you. But when I think of the suffering my mistake caused you, there is no comparison. Above all, I express my apology to Shinji, and, of course, also to Mama. As for myself, I want to ask you not to condemn Papa simply on the... ... grounds of what has happened. I share responsibility also having caused Papa to do this. I deeply regret that your father and I were not... ... an ideal couple you could be proud of. Yes, but as I said a moment ago, you were vaguely aware of it. But I could not let the issue lie as it was. I knew eventually someday I should state the facts and ask you to understand the situation. That's what I thought. Although Mama says she is responsible too... ... it was all my own fault. Not entirely. I think that Mama didn't have enough sex appeal. That could be an explanation. But such explanations... I never knew about it. If I had, I wouldn't have been so nice to him. But Yukichi, let's take this opportunity to re-welcome brother Shinji into this home. As unworthy older and younger brother, right. Shinji, let's get along... Just your unworthy sister. Fine. Firstly, I'm grateful to Papa. If you hadn't been fickle, I wouldn't exist. Human existence transcends all ethics. Thank you, Papa. And then I must thank my broad-minded Mama. You never tried to force me to become your own child. You provided me with a healthy environment. What else could have given me greater happiness? Mama, I thank you. I am grateful for the sound conclusions you have reached. Let's put an end to this subject. Miss Kuramoto, I'm sorry. So, since we are all together let's sing a song. Whenever the family is all together, we form a chorus. Please join us tonight. At times like this, Papa must use his loud voice to sing. So, let's sing. {\i1\an8}Katare me de shi ma-gokoro hisashiki mukashi no Tell me the tales that to me were so dear, long, long ago {\i1\an8}utae yukashi shirabe o sugishi mukashi no Sing me the songs I delighted to hear, long, long ago {\i1\an8}nare kaerinu aa ureshi Now you are come, all my grief is removed, {\i1\an8}nagaki wakare aa yume ka Let me forget that so long you have roved, {\i1\an8}mezuru omoi kawarazu hisashiki ima mo Let me believe that you love as you loved long, long ago {\i1\an8}Ai shi komichi wasureji hisashiki mukashi no Do you remember the path where we met, long, long ago? {\i1\an8}ge nimo kataki chikai yo sugishi mukashi no Then, to all others my smile you preferred, long, long ago {\i1\an8}nagaemai hito ni home Love, when you spoke, {\i1\an8}na ga kataru ai ni you gave a charm to each word, {\i1\an8}yasashi kotoba nokore ni hisashiki ima mo Still my heart treasures the praises I heard, long, long ago Mama, maybe I'll take Miss Kuramoto for a ride tonight. That is OK, if she is wants to. Shinji, where do you suggest we go? I'd say... Somewhere around the Noborito golf course. Okay, I'll do that. But don't send me a telegram in the middle of the night. I won't. - Bye. - Please come again. Miss Kuramoto, this... You must have been surprised. Yes, there are not many families like that. Somehow false, and yet somehow noble. Each individual faces life with a firm confidence. I felt a clear, transparent atmosphere. PART 2 I'm sorry to disturb you while studying. Mother invites you to lunch. Thanks! What's the occasion? Nothing special. Only mother brought home part of a banquet. Ah, like that. I'll be glad to come. Say, Sis, it's very strange. Please look at this. It's from Kumiko, right? OK if I take a look? "Meet me in front of the Jingu Gaien art gallery at 7 a.m. on the 11th." "I'll be waiting for you. Kumiko" See, strange, right? Not strange at all. She'll be waiting in front of Gaien tomorrow morning at 7. It's a nice letter. Sis, you're slow. It's 7 in the morning! I'm still sound asleep when she wakes up at that hour. It is crazy to meet at such a time. Come to think of it, it is. 7 a.m. You're right. That'll be hard, for sure. but tomorrow you need to get up with the milk men to meet her, right? Shall I lend you my alarm? I have not decided to go or not. For her to get there by 7, getting up at 5:30 will not do. A girl takes time to fix and comb her hair. Then she has to take the train, go to Gaien and wait. It would be strange for anyone. Don't ask me. Don't be nasty. You got a nice painting, Sis. It's a picture from Shinji. What? That guy drew it? That cannot pass as a bridge. Awful. Tamio, what are you doing? Please bring Miss Kuramoto with you. I'm coming. My! It looks delicious. Who is it? It's the friend from the New Year's party. Please, come in. Tamio, what's the matter with you? Isn't he your friend? I don't know the guy. He's no friend of mine. I don't know what kind of fellow he is! But he came on New Year's... I'm sorry. I'm not a friend of Tamio,... ... I'm his brother. Tamio's brother? Yes, his brother. I'm your son, Shinji Tashiro. Yes, he is, auntie. I know because I'm the tutor of Shinji's sister. Really? So you are Shinji? I... I am Tomi. I cannot look you properly in the eye... ...since I could not take care of you. Don't apologize, mother. He is not a daytime ghost. Showing up suddenly like this, it's disgusting he calls himself brother! I wish you'd get out of here. Tamio, don't talk like that. Get out. There's no reason for you to hate Shinji. Unlike him, you were brought up by your own mother. He was... I appreciate the fine way in which you brought me up. I had no shoes to wear when I went to school. I had to steal vegetables which I ate raw. I won't forget it. What are you saying! I did what I could but it was beyond my power. I once was so hungry, I stole a piece of bread. I had to listen to the baker lecturing me all the time. And you apologize, bowing to the floor! At that time... ...unlike me, he was living a lavish life. I don't want a brother like that. I have had enough. He is lying, Shinji. Tamio never stole any bread. He was a good child, first in his class. There is no need to be ashamed of him as your brother. Mother. I don't think it is bad for a hungry child to steal bread. But... it's cowardly to hold a grudge against the past, and harbor an inferiority complex. What! Tamio, Shinji is just saying good things about you. Shinji... Why do you treat Shinji so special? We are brothers, so why are you discriminating against me? That's... Don't say such silly things. What are you saying? What about me discriminating against you for once? Mr. Tamio. Special Mr. Tamio. Boss Tamio. Honored Mr. Tamio. Satisfied? You bastard! Please don't be foolhardy. You're so old fashioned. I get it, I'll get going. Forget the past. Be sensible. Look at it a bit more loose. I'll show you how some day how to be your brother. Excuse me, mother. Weren't you a bit too rough on him? I think it was just right. Suits him right. Bastard! I'm getting to like him. Won't you show me your room? Come in. It's nice. Like my dog house. Ah? I painted that one. Thanks. Good morning. I doubted if you would come so early. I was surprised because you wrote 7 a.m. I have no other choice, In the morning I have school, in the afternoon the air is dirty, and the night belongs to adults. So for us, only this time remains. That's right. And the morning air is so pure. It feels like it's been a while since we met. That's true. You've changed a bit. You too. How? You became more adult. You too. We both had some troubles, right? Sure we had troubles! Yesterday, your brother Shinji came. Did you welcome him? I didn't. I felt he might come between you and me. I wonder, are we so intimate? But I don't like it. I don't like us having the same brother. Did you weep when Shinji came? Mother did. And you? Who, me? I...? Don't lie to me. Well, I... wept. That's no good. I'm disappointed. Although you like jazz, you're old fashioned. Your brother said so too. Let's walk a bit. You're pretty. Do you think so? I do. Do you think I said something pretentious? I do not. I am happy. Because it's you who praised me. It's heavy. All textbooks? Breakfast and lunch as well. You didn't eat yet, right? Let's eat together somewhere. Yes but only if you have enough. That's OK. What are you thinking? When I was a second grader I once went to that hospital. Were you sick? I felt ashamed in the women's group, so I had a doctor check my body. With mother? No. I went all by myself. Kumiko Tashiro. Mrs. Tashiro. Is Kumiko Tashiro not here? Are you the patient? I'm Kumiko Tashiro. I see. Come in. Miss Tashiro, over here. Haven't you come here by mistake? This is maternity. Yes, I know. You're Dr. Shiozawa, right? I checked you are here on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Why did you want to see me? Rumor has it that you are very rude to patients. If you think I am such a rude doctor, why did you choose to come here? Well, I feel a rude doctor knows his business best. But why did you come in the first place? I want you to check if I can bear children. Doctor, please look. Ah, it's your leg. Yes, my lower back. Sit down. I've had an inferiority complex since childhood... because I think I cannot bear children. Wait a second. Isn't it premature... ...for a first grader to think about having children? You are a gynecologist, yet you don't know such things? Do you examine only the body and not the spirit? You are very frank. Say, nurse... Did you think about bearing children in elementary school? Let me see... It never occurred to me. But what she says... ... reminds me of an unconscious longing. Of course, it was nothing physical. I see. My oversight. You look very healthy. You are a pretty girl with personality. Your back problem has nothing to do with bearing children. As a specialist, I guarantee you. Doctor, how can you say that without examining me? It's experience. You may have experience, but I came to be examined. You're stubborn. I'm being sympathetic. I know without examining you. A scientist should disregard sentimentality. What!? When my children get too fresh, I slap them on the cheek. It's discipline. But I can't with you. All right, I'll examine you. Get behind there. Why are you shaking like that? You're perfectly healthy. I diagnose that you can have plenty of children. Well, are you happy now? I really will be happy... ...in a couple of weeks. But now... Now? I wish you take a dose of poison by mistake... ...and suddenly die. Because I saw your body? I'd like to satisfy you, but I have a family to take care of, so... I can't die for your sake. I'm sorry. In a few minutes this feeling... ... will surely disappear. I'll be going home. Please do. You're a little upset but... ...when you go out... ....don't forget to pay. I won't. Well, I must go to school. The first lesson will just be finished. Will you be OK? Let me practice: Teacher... I had a stomachache this morning and wanted to skip class. But it feels a lot better now... Really? Weren't you loitering on your way? You smell of earth and grass. But go to your seat. Are you Mr. Tashiro? I am. I'm Kamijima. I need to talk to you so won't you come with me. This is weird. You look just like a gang. I haven't got a clue, but... ...I'll go along with you. But I'm hungry. Will you treat? Soba or sushi, anything you want. As long as you just get in the car. Get in. Yuri! Yes? I brought him along. I see. Please wait a second... OK. You talked about soba from the neighborhood. Could I have some? You're a nuisance. Hey, go get some soba! We want to have a bite too, so get five. Make it two for me... OK, bring six! Yuri, if you don't come out it'll be difficult to continue this conversation. I'm coming. Where is he? Hey, isn't this guy Tashiro? This guy? No, this isn't him. You guys, I hope you didn't treat this gentleman rough. We asked him to come politely! You're really a bunch of fools! We've slipped up. Hey Kamijima, this lady's name is Yuriko, isn't it? Yuriko is holding back because I am here, but do you know what she'd shout at you? She'd say: "The man I want is not a homely boy like this. But a better and much more handsome one." But you're good looking. I must apologize. Please go now. But you can slap each one of these guys if you like. Don't be funny. It is not only their fault. It looks like I'm the brother of the man you want. You are Yukichi's... ...younger brother, Shinji. No wonder we made a mistake. I thought he was kind of dumb. You shut up! Ken, what a mess you've made. You think you're a gangster, but this isn't even funny. You blame me, but this guy is a strange guy. He just wouldn't respond to us. He was so indifferent, we got mixed up. Of course he'd be indifferent. I'm awfully sorry. I'm Yuriko Kawakami, fashion model. I'm ashamed of the way we met. Ken, take him back home in the car. I'm sorry I'm looking like this on our first meeting. It's more like a privilege... ...to meet a fashion model this way. If you were your brother, I would say something different. Well, how about telling me instead. I have time since the soba is still not here. Surprised? Not really. I know - I've caused you agony in the past. And you've endured it. What's this about? I know you'll never talk. That's why I'm asking you another favor. You see... The hint for this plan came because they mistook... you for me and took you to Yuriko's. Welcome. Make it real hot. Watch out, something is showing. That's no good. But it comes in handy. A piece of octopus. It ran away on all eight of his legs. How about squid? Good enough. I don't make sense, do I? Mama, I want to talk to you. I thought so. You two talked it over. I guess it's bad news. Papa's home, so better talk in a low voice. I asked the advice of Yukichi, and we decided the only way was to ask you. How unusual. Till now you've always handled your own problems. This time I can't. I've gotten myself into trouble with a girl. What, you? What kind of woman? A fashion model. Unbelievable! You're not the type to attract a girl with that job. I can't believe it. Mama, you're cruel. Do I look so unattractive to women? I didn't say that. I mean a girl who is conscious of her beauty... ...will not likely fall for a man with your nature. It's no use arguing about it. She's got bad friends - who are threatening Shinji. That's no good! Why are they threatening him? For money. She had it all planned out. Right, Shinji? Yes. I'm terribly sorry. She wants a million. But I think it can be settled at one third. Shinji, did you treat this fashion model so cruelly? I know about it. I heard - she had been pregnant twice. And when he got tired of her, he had affairs with other members of her group. How horrible! Shinji, is this true? Mama, I'm ashamed. I'm born with it. Shut up. I was not asking you. Shinji, take me to this girl. I want to talk to her myself. Mama, you had better not. She's surrounded by hoodlums. Please let me handle it this time. Are you so sure you can handle hoodlums? Maybe I can't. But they mistook me for Shinji and took me to her place. I told them I'd settle it. You might make things worse. So Mama, let me handle it. You're a good brother. Shinji, you must be grateful. Mama, I'm sorry. Yukichi, I'll give you the money tomorrow. It went off well. I'm indebted. I'm going out for a while. I'd like to talk to you. Oh! Midori. This manuscript is really fascinating. It's gonna be a best-seller. What were you... I'm... I'm so terribly distressed. What happened? It's Shinji. That fool. I'll talk to you later. What are you doing, Shinji? Ah, it's you, Mama. You were shouting rather strange. I felt so ashamed. I just didn't know what else to do. What are you ashamed of? What? About that girl. Liar! You were disgusted with your own lies. Listening to both of you with your well-planned lies... I felt like shouting myself. Mama, I really don't know what you're talking about. I replaced you and Yukichi in my mind as I listened. You can imagine how miserable I felt listening to you. That role as bad guy you took... ...was that to satisfy your sense of superiority? That's cruel, Mama. Say such things in front of him. Yukichi is probably drinking somewhere. He may lack conscience, but after such down-right lies, what can he do but get drunk? Say, Mama, what made you think that we were telling lies? Rather, I'd like to ask you... ...why you two came up with the same type of lie as with Kumiko? The same with you, Mama. If you knew, why didn't you expose him immediately? Now I understand. That was your purpose - of telling another lie. You wanted to put me in the same position as with Kumiko's accident. And have me expose Yukichi. So that was it? I wasn't thinking such difficult things. I only thought that if you had told him before... ...he might have been a different man. So... ...you wanted to hit me where it hurts most. But you are right, Shinji. I could not do it. That Yukichi was raised with such a character... ...is nothing but my fault. I feel like exposing his character... ...is like exposing myself. But what if I did? Or was forced to? What would happen to him? Yukichi would be humiliated to the point of dying. Could he go on living? That's why I pity him. The more he hides his conscience, the more I feel sorry for him. I just can't... Mama, I understand. Say Shinji. After you're all married, Papa and I intend to live alone. But if Papa should die before me, and I can't get along, I was thinking of... ...living either with Kumiko or with you. Will you take me in? Yes, sure. Mama, you're not very happy. Don't be deceived by sentiments. I might start to be mean to you. Don't be caught off guard. I won't. We saw Yukichi walking, getting all wet in the rain. I was returning from the opera with Miss Kumiko... but he didn't stop our taxi. And? And when I met him on the Ginza later... For a regular date? No, it was a coincidence. Really? Don't move. Your dog is not here today? The dog is on a date today. Next door. What did he say? He said... ...you had a fight with hoodlums. And he had mediated the controversy. Did he say that? Yes, but what was it all about? Tell me. Didn't he tell you? Why do you want me to tell you what he wouldn't? Don't tell me if you don't want to. There is nothing I have done that I can't talk about. If I killed someone, I'd talk about it. Please don't bother. I was a fool to want to hear about your blunder. I don't want sympathy. I played around and did wrong to a fashion model. Then she demanded money from me. Brother fixed it up. I don't believe it. But it is the truth! I got her pregnant twice, destroying her body. Then I got tired of her... ...and went after her friends. Stop it. I don't believe you. I thought it was something we could laugh about. I'm not such a puritan as you think I am. I fulfill my desires. I am a typical Jekyll and Hyde. And I don't care what you know about me. I don't care because you're nothing to me. Shinji, you're insulting me. Why do you say that? I don't think I'm wonderful myself, but... ...I don't like to be insulted by you. On the contrary, you insulted me. That mean look you had when you asked about my blunder. I'll never forget it, so I told you everything you wanted to know. I'm such a person. We had better part. I won't. I don't believe you. No way you could be so filthy. No matter what you say, I just know it isn't true. I want to understand you better. I want to know everything, your weaknesses too. That's why I definitively won't part with you. Do as you like, but I warn you I'll get you into trouble. I ruined the life of that fashion model. I'm such a person. And I'm not ashamed of it. I'll lock it. Cool down and carefully think it over. - I'm home. - Hello. Going out? Say, Kumiko. Go and see the new female dog we have. She's pretty. But she's excited and may bite. What's this, not a new dog but my tutor! What a mean thing for him to do. I'm glad I came home early to ask you for advice. I was waiting for you. You don't seem to be angry at all. No, I'm not. I'll get even with him. So what was on your mind? It's a naughty scheme with good intentions. I'm curious. Brother! I knew roughly where you'd be but we had to look quite a bit. Good afternoon, Shinji. We happened to meet Tamio. We brought delicious fruits and cakes. Let's eat together. Let's look at Shinji's painting. Come on. I won't go. You tricked me. I would never have come. Me too. If I'd known you were bringing that punk, I wouldn't have told you where I would go. I just don't like him. I'm going back. Wiseguy! Hey, wait a minute. Remember? I said I'll show you I'm your elder brother. I think it's time to show you. The place is just right, too. Or maybe you're scared and want to run? What? Tamio, please don't. And you too. The girls planned this. We don't need their humanism. But this is women's sense. Don't you think so? I don't know. I just dislike you. Who does he think he is? I'll show you who I am. The ladies can sit over there and watch. Like a bullfight. At times like this, when women try to stop us men, we get more excited. It's like seeing red. All right. We'll just sit and watch while peeling an apple. Let's go, tutor. Let's sit here. What would you like? Apple. Come on. Let's see if a no-good singer can fight. I don't want a cowardly brother. Shit... You bastard! I wonder if Tamio is dead. He doesn't move anymore. Come on, Tamio... Are you satisfied? Or do you still not have enough? OK. I'll admit you're my big brother. I do. I'll admit I'm your kid brother. Tomio, you lost the fight. Shinji made you fall, you did not get up... I thought you were dead or something. When all of a sudden you began to cry... ... I cried too. I feel so happy. You've got a nice brother. But I admire the way you persisted till the end. Though you have a black eye... and were beaten up... ...Don't worry. I like and admire you all the more. Everything turned out... ...for the better. You can cry. You can go ahead and cry as much as you want. I'm sorry about it. Is it spoiled? Don't think about it. But doesn't that bruise hurt? Not at all. I have a wonderful idea. Let's all celebrate tonight. I agree! Let's all drink together. To my ruined painting. And to my bruise and black eye. I was bullied when I was a kid. I always fought back. I'd throw stones. But I'd get beaten up in the end. I wouldn't stop. But if we had only been together then. Tamio looks happy. But they're letting us women dance alone. How impolite! But let's leave them alone for a while. Tamio, are you drunk? I only feel drunk. I was just a bit flustered. I was quite surprised. Saying 'brother', 'brother' all the time. Two men dancing, I felt embarrassed. So it's better if we fight? You're drunk! Terrible. You must be thinking Tamio is cute, calling you 'brother' all the time... You probably feel very happy. I won't be sentimental about it. But to know there's another being born from the same mother... Not a bad feeling. Is that all? Just a bit. Everybody, attention please! I want to thank you all for coming in such numbers tonight. I've been watching you all enjoying yourselves in this club. And among you I noticed... ...the promise of our jazz club: Jimmy Koike. The reason I was able to spot him in this crowd... ...was because he was dancing with a boy. We would like Jimmy to sing a song for us. Jimmy Koike, go ahead! - What should I do? - Go, go! Good evening, everybody. I'm Jimmy Koike. The manager said my dance partner was a boy. It's true. But I am not like that. I like kind girls... ... better than boys. I'm happy... ... and a little drunk. So I may sing badly, so let's sing this song all together. And be merry. I'll sing "7 O'Clock." He's good tonight. Tamio, take a look at those two. It's been strange for a while now. Those sparkling eyes... ... and how they stare at each other. Well, they're older than us. They probably have emotions we are not aware of. Just leave them alone. Ah, you smell of alcohol. But I'm worried. It looks as if Miss Kuramoto was going into a trance. You should apologize to Miss Kuramoto. Such dreadful action in front of so many people! I don't blame her for being angry. Apologize to Takako. Go on, apologize. I won't. She was asking me for it. She was. She wanted to know everything about me. That's why I showed her. I definitively won't apologize. I'm not ashamed of anything I did. I understand the way you feel. But women want to be handled more gently. You seem to know a great deal about women. She handed me a handkerchief. To wipe my wet hands, she handed me a handkerchief. I knew that she loved me. She forgave me everything. At least that's what she said. And that is why I had to kiss Takako. I wanted to hold her ever since I first met her. I wanted to hold her close to my body. Yes... How I've longed for her. I have. Well, OK... I'll go home and think about it. Kumiko, please have your geometry done by tomorrow. Yes, I'll have it all done. Tamio... You take Kumiko safely home tonight. Yes, I'll take her home. Brother, you... I'll stay behind and have another drink. I'm sorry, Tamio. I should not have hit you. I'm sorry, OK? I've had quite an experience today. Tamio, fold your arms behind you and grab your hands. Close your eyes. Like this? Now we're even. You stand here and watch me enter the gate. Then you can go. Goodbye. Mrs. Kuramoto, I'm back. Welcome home. I have returned the key to Tamio. Thank you very much. Good night. Goodnight. Mother... What is it? Are you still awake? Is there anything? You return here every evening and keep complaining... ... saying things to yourself. What the heck are you saying? "I'm gonna kick him, that boy of mine." If a woman lives alone for too long she will start talking to herself. I have nobody to consult so I can only consult myself. I would not ask you to listen to my problems. Say, Mother... Is there anything else? If so, be quick about it. Did you get a girlfriend? Who is she? I won't say anything. Please tell me quickly. I don't like hesitant people. I would sometime like to see the guy who came here as my brother. Sometime, here? You mean Shinji? Shinji... Did you meet Shinji somewhere and become friends? That's right. I decided to call him my brother. I see. That's good. I am relieved to hear that. But mother... ... that brother is quite big. And he does not understand many things. If I don't look over his shoulder there's no knowing what he'll do. Don't be impertinent. What can you do looking over his shoulder? At this age he will be making advances to women. Not too successful. Can't bear to watch it. Do you know how to make advances yourself? When did you learn that? You can only make advances to a woman once in your life. Then she'll be your wife. I won't consent to you becoming good at doing weird things. No, no, mother. I have no idea. But Tamio, I have lived quite a hard life, but ... Both you and Shinji... I am very happy the children I bore have become respectable people. You might regret feeling good about it. I might start giving you trouble from now on. Once a boy starts liking a girl, his parents' luck ends. But I would like to meet the girl you like shortly. You did not fool around, so you can get a good girl. You bet! You will live long, Mama. So take it easy. Shall I hand her to you? Please do. Tamio, there's one thing I want to ask you. Whatever you do, please do not ask Shinji for any money. Don't do such a shameful thing. Don't underestimate me, mother. I see, Tamio. Let's go to sleep. What an insolent, shameless man he is! But I just can't get myself to despise or hate him. And that's why I despise myself. But what can I do? My eyes... They seem to emit something wild and savage. That I possessed such passions within me, I was not aware till today. And I feel the same passions - emanating from him. When I'm alone with Shinji... ...there are times I hear him calling me from deep inside his body. But... perhaps... that may be the voice inside my body... ...echoing back at myself. It's true I thought I loved Yukichi. That's why when you said you loved me - I had to walk in the snow like a fool - to suppress my happiness. But... you were too perfect for me. When I was with you I had to always be on guard. I had to try to be a woman worthy of your love. But when I was with Shinji, I never had that feeling. I could be myself. I could be frank and natural and never feel embarrassed. And now I have come to realize why. I know Shinji got into trouble with a woman. In spite of this, I couldn't get myself to hate him when he kissed me. On the contrary, I recall that savage kiss with a sweet memory I can never forget. It's because I'm in love with Shinji. It's the only explanation. So you are in love with Shinji and not me? You talked a lot just to say that. And you did it very kindly. Hey, Shinji. You did pretty well for yourself. With a geisha as mother... blood relatives are frightening. Stop it, Shinji. Shinji, it's OK. I've thought I should be beaten up by you. That's why I insulted you. But it's enough. You hit hard. I don't want to get disfigured. You may think it's strange, but it's true. I dislike human beings. I'm serious. It's about Yuriko. We told Mama a big lie about her. Ever since then... I wanted to go away and live somewhere else... away from Papa and Mama... I hated to be in their vicinity. I had enough of my life, that started with a lie. It's difficult to remedy it, but if one tries hard enough... Well, I must examine my patients. Shinji's a fine boy, but he has an inferiority complex which makes him seclude himself. I've taken advantage of that nature since he was a child. For example, the affair I told you he had with a fashion model... No, I... No, Shinji. Let me tell the truth. It was I who got into trouble with the... That's enough. I just want to say this to Takako. Have you noticed how his paintings lack force? It's the inferiority complex within him. Your love can free him of it. I've heard enough about myself. I feel like running away. Never mind. I'm going, surgery begins. When I see them cutting into people's bodies, I feel better. Giving the handkerchief to me... ...proved your love. It surely was an expression of your love. Your emotions were what made you do it. And... And? And that's why I kissed you. Well, you said so. Someone might come. Let's go. It went well, right? They said it will heal and not be noticeable anymore. Wonderful! You see men pacing the corridor when their wife is having a baby. That's the way I felt now. Don't be silly. Better be careful. I know how to use my fists with men. But isn't it wonderful? After 10 years... I'll walk without a limp. Yes, let's take long walks together. THE END Translation corrected by @-butaniku-@
