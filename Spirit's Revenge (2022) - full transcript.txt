[gentle somber music] [gentle ominous music] - Death, oh, Death, hear my prayer. Help me now in my great despair. Grant your power and come into me. Elaina, you can't be here. - What are you doing? - I, I'm sure Arnet has someone else and... - And you're doing this? I asked you not to. - I, I just want to know for sure. I can't have his children if he... - If he what? All men do this. - Not mine. And if he is... - You'll what, kill him? - No, I, I could never do that. - Then break from him then, humiliate him. - No, yes, I don't know. I, I just want to find out. - Elaina, Theresa, what, what have you done? This is magic. If anyone hears about this, there's, there's gonna be a burning. - I told you. - [Theresa] You told him? - Yes, I asked you not to do this, and you wouldn't stop. - Why? You were my friend. - He is my lover. [deep foreboding music] - How could you do this to me? You whore. [deep tense music] - Stop it. - I'll ruin you. I'll ruin you both. - No, [shrill tense music] [Theresa gasps] you won't. [body thuds] [tense ominous music] [Theresa whimpers] - I'm sorry, she left me no other option. [deep tense music] [Theresa gasps] [body thuds] [gentle ominous music] [Arnet sighs] This isn't what I wanted. - She shouldn't have threatened us. - No, she shouldn't have threatened you. - Why are you mad at me? You killed her. - No, I finished her. Come on, let's let her die in peace. [deep ominous music] - Grant your power and come into me, Death of death, here my plea. [tense ominous music] - [Spirit] Free me and you will have what you want. [bright chiming music] [tense foreboding music] Rise, renewed. - Yes. - [Spirit] I will grant you this, but you must serve me for a time. - Death, I will serve you for a time. - [Spirit] Deal. [tense foreboding music] - You're gonna have to fix this. - Why me? [hand slaps] - Never raise your voice at me again. You caused this, this is all your fault. - You can't! [hand slaps] - Do you understand? - Yes. - Good, now let's go clean up your mess. You'll need to... How did you? - My new lover, Death.

[zip hisses] Yeah, oh. - Oh. - Babe, babe, babe, baby. - Looks like you're enjoying it. - Don't stop, don't stop. [deep ominous music] - What the hell? Why is the car shaking? - I don't know. - Oh goddamn, it's the po-po. Pull your pants up, Henry! [scoffs] Get out. [electronics beeping] What? - What was making the car shake? - Yeah, yeah, it stopped as soon as we got out. What was up with that light? - Was me. [shrill ominous music] - Bitch, the fuck did do you to my car? [Henry gasps] - [Nina] No! [bones crack] - No!

I don't love him anymore! - Why you still with him? - Why does that tombstone have my name on it? Please! - You die now. [flames fluttering] - No, I promise I won't anything, I promise! [flames fluttering] - We still know very little about these strange killings, but the police are telling us that they are doing all they can to apprehend the person or persons responsible. In a statement released today, they recommend if you don't have to go out, don't. [footsteps clicking] [keyboard clicking] - All right, I've got errands I've gotta do. I'll be back in two hours. - But it's time for my lunch, and what about that seminar I'm supposed to attend this afternoon? - You can go to lunch when I come back, cancel the seminar, you've got work to do. - [scoffs] I see how it is. - I'm sure you do. [footsteps clicking] - What a bitch. [books rasps] - Can I help you find something? - Oh, do you work here? - No, but I could help. - And why would you wanna do that? - Just trying to be a gentleman. Hi, my name's Craig. - Zoey and I'm not wearing a wedding ring, but I am married. - Well, I'm also married. But who says we can't be friends? - What makes you think I want a new friend? - I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. You have any kids? - Don't have time for any. - [Craig] Me either. It sounds like we have something in common. Kinda work do you do? - I own an accounting firm. - Ooh, sounds exciting. I'm a graphic designer. I specialize in websites, if you need one. - Huh, only if you do it for free. [Craig chuckles] - Give me a call, I'll be glad to. [business cards rustle] - Thanks, I'll think about it. - All right, friend. [Zoey breathing heavily] That was amazing! - You tell all the losers you bring here that? - No, just you. - Oh, how did I get so lucky? [Craig sighs] - You ever see somebody, and without knowing anything about them, tell yourself that this is the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with? - Mm, I could feel that vibe. [lips smacking] Or maybe I was just bored and looking for something different. - So how long have you been married? - Mm, almost five years. - Hmm, and when did he get erectile dysfunction? [slap thuds] - You're so mean. [Craig chuckles] - Maybe that's what you like about me. - Conceded much? - Confident. - Mm. - So why'd you get married? - Honestly, I was broke and I really wanted my own firm, you? - We were college sweethearts, we've been married for about eight years. Everything started off great, but then she just started nagging me about every little thing, and I realized.. I couldn't live my life like that anymore. - Are you sure that you want something else or is this just recreational? - Well, she has female problems. She can't get pregnant again. And I can feel us growing apart. It's like she's more into having a baby than being with me. - And how many other women have you seen since your marriage started falling apart? - Four, you? - You're my first. [Craig chuckles] [Zoey chuckles] [lips smacking] Do you think she suspects you? - Oh yeah, she has her suspicions. But your husband will probably start suspecting you too. - Oh, I'll keep an eye out. Wanna fuck again? [Zoey and Craig chuckle] - Oh man, you're crazy. Oh, my dick is damn near raw. - I can put some lube on it with my tongue. [Craig sighs] [lips smacking] - No, you gotta save some for tomorrow. I gotta get home. - No. - Yes. [lips smacking] I gotta go. - Okay. [lips smacking] [sheets rustle] - I can't believe how well we hit it off. - I know, [lips smack] I thought you were gonna be a piece of ass. [Craig chuckles] But I think there's a whole lot more to explore. [lips smacking] - Well, I'm in. [Zoey chuckles] [lips smacking] - It's a shame though, that we're married to the wrong people. - Yeah, we are. - Hmm. I think they need to go. - We could ask for divorces. - No, like they need to go. [tense foreboding music] - Oh. [tense foreboding music] - I have an idea. - What's that? - We could kill 'em. [Zoey giggles] - That'd be a little crazy. Just a little bit. - Would it? [tense foreboding music] - Hmm, I don't know. [lips smacking] - It's a bit later than usual. Did you finish? - Sorry, I'm so late. Yeah, I had a proposal that I had to stay late for. - I wish you'd hire more people. - I know, and pretty soon things will level out and then we can spend more time together. [Zoey sighs] I gotta go wash off. [shoes thud] [water spattering] [gentle sultry music] - You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Smart, beautiful, great in bed. - Oh, you make me feel so good. - [exhales] Yeah, you feel good. - I love touching you. - I like when you touch me. [Zoey moans] [lips smacking] - There is only one problem, your wife and my husband. [deep tense music] [water pattering] [tense somber music] [loofah thumps] [lamp clangs] What was that? - Sorry, honey, didn't mean to scare ya. I knocked over the lamp. - All right. - By the way, I just took a little blue pill! - Great, give me a minute. [tense foreboding music] [deep dramatic music] [Franklin exhales] - This is some really, really good wine. - You're so heavy. [Zoey sighs] [glass shatters] Crap, I'll clean that up later. [alarm beeping] Franklin. [tense ominous music] Franklin? [tense ominous music] Yes, hi, my husband isn't breathing. Please, send an ambulance. Send help, please [sobs]. [deep dramatic music] [Zoey sighs] He's in here. [footsteps thudding] - Where? - I don't understand, he was right here. - Are you sure he was here? Positive. [tense ominous music] - Is this your blood? - Uh-uh, uh, no. - Hey, hey, who is this? - Franklin, darling, you're alive. - So where did the blood come from? Were y'all two fighting? - My, my husband broke a wine glass last night. He must have gotten the glass in the bed. [tense ominous music] - That's odd. [tense ominous music] Sir, are you okay? Do you need to be checked out? - No, no, I, I, I'm fine. I don't know why my wife called you. - Sounds like a damn prank. You interrupted me in the middle of my breakfast for this bullshit. - Look, everybody's fine. Y'all can go now. - I'm gonna be sick again. - [Zoey] Oh, Franklin. - [Paramedic] Let's go. [Franklin retching] [coffee pot clangs] - You were out late last night. - Yeah, I was training the new guy. [chair rumbles] - Did you hear on the news about someone going around knocking off folks who were messing around on their husbands and wives? - Yeah, I heard about it, but I didn't pay much attention to it. - You know, I believe that if someone is unhappily married, they should say something. - Yeah, totally agree. Maybe their situation was complicated. - You know, I think, I believe that when you're married, you're married until death do you part. - Yeah. - Yeah, if I ever found out you were cheating on me, I couldn't survive a divorce. I consider a divorce to be worse than death. - So you'd rather die than have a divorce? - Yeah, especially since we've been together for so long. - Well, that's good to know. [Craig chuckles] - I have another appointment with the fertility doctor. - Look, I'm tired of trying to get pregnant, Let it go, find a hobby. - I'm going to keep trying. [door creaks] - What is that noise? - It's the hallway closet, it still needs to be fixed. - I'll take a look. [footsteps thudding] Why does it make that sound? [door creaks] - Because your cousin didn't fix it right. [door creaks] - I have to go to work. - Oh, maybe after work we can go out to dinner? - I gotta work late. - [Veronica] Okay, I'll stay up for you and I wanna make love tonight. [gentle piano music] [door clicks] [gentle piano music] [car engine whirring] [trash can rattles] [dog howls] [car door thuds] [dog barking] [tense eerie music] [dog howls] [keyboard clicking] [cellphone buzzes] - Hey, yeah, I'm almost done. Give me a few more minutes, I'll print it and bring it to you. [deep tense music] Where's my stuff? [cellphone chimes] [deep tense music] What the fuck? Hello? Hello? Who are you? Why are you sending me text messages? [deep tense music] What the hell's wrong with this computer? Where's my stuff, damn it? Oh crap, crap, crap! [fist thuds] [Craig sighs] [deep tense music] [Craig sighs] [footsteps clicking] [toilet gurgling] [dispenser wining] [paper towel rasps] [Craig sighs] [water sloshes] [shrill suspenseful music] - [Spirit] Cheater. [door thuds] - Who's there? [exhales] Come on man, it's just an empty stall. [shrill suspenseful music] [paper towel rasps] [toilet gurgles] - [Spirit] Cheater, cheater. - Who's there? Fuck is this happening to me? [toilet gurgles] [tense ominous music] Who's there? Who are you? Are you following me around? [tense ominous music] [toilet gurgles] [paper towel rasps] Look at this damn mirror, look what someone wrote. Someone's trying to kill me. - Dude, what's wrong with you? There's nothing on that mirror. - It's right there. Somebody was just here. - Dude, you need to miss this meeting. Go home, you don't need nobody looking at you like this. [tense ominous music] [footsteps clicking] [door rattling] - Come on! [door creaks] [handbag thuds] Craig? [tense eerie music] [door creaks and thuds] [eerie ominous music] [toothbrush rasping] [door thuds] Shit! [gentle ominous music] [door handle rattles] Hello? [door handle rattles] [hands thumping] Hello? Help. [hands thumping] Craig? [door handle rattles] Please. [Zoey gasps] Shit! - [Craig] Are you okay? - Yeah, The door was stuck. Did you close it? - No, I just was walking in and I heard you scream. - It scared the shit out of me. - Well, it's a new building. It's probably just a faulty lock, come on. - Craig, why do we have to stay here? It's so far away from everything. - Zoey, I've told you 18 times, we can't go anywhere else. We might get seen. Look, we could go somewhere nicer, but then we're gonna have to drive 40 miles out of the way. It's gonna take that much longer to get back. Is that what you want? - No, I guess we can keep meeting here. I'm just tired of sneaking around all the time. When are we gonna tell them that we want a separation? - [sighs] I don't know. My wife's been acting real strange. - Well, she's probably scared, she's suspicious. She doesn't wanna lose you. - Is it raining? I didn't know what was supposed to rain, I hope I pulled my car windows up. - Maybe it's gonna rain later. [gentle eerie music] - I don't like it. What the hell is that? - What? [wind gushes] [door slams] [gentle eerie music] [Zoey and Craig panting] What was that? - I don't know, must have been like a dust devil or something. Check the weather. [gentle eerie music] - Woman were found dead in a motel on 19th Street. According to a note found by the investigators, the man was another victim of the Spirit's Revenge Killer. The man was married and, again, apparently not to the woman he was with. In other news... - Screw the weather, that's just right up the road. How could this happen this close and we not hear about it? - I don't know. It was one thing when these killings were random, it's like the suspect knows who these people are! Knows who we are! We could be next! - Craig, do you think we're on a hit list? [gentle dramatic music] - I don't know. Maybe we should just enjoy the time that we have together. - Yeah, whatever time we have left. - I won't let anything happen to us. [gentle dramatic music] - Thanks for last night. - Well, we didn't do anything. - I know, it's obvious that you're doing it with somebody else, so you may as well sleep in the guest bedroom. [gentle quirky music] - How dare you come into my house, you dumb son of a bitch! [Craig groans] - Craig, what are you doing? Why are you choking my dummy? [Craig pants] - Oh jeez, I thought it was alive. The hell is this thing anyway? [Veronica chuckles] - Sometimes when I'm running late for work, I drive in the HOV lane and I need the dummy to make it look like I have a passenger. [gentle quirky music] [footsteps clacking] [gentle bright music] - These are for you? - For me? Wow. [gentle bright music] Who are they from? - No idea, I've been trained not to read the card. Maybe they're from your husband. Who else would be sending you flowers? - Absolutely no one. They look just like my wedding bouquet. [gentle bright music] Hmm, that's weird, the card's blank. - Maybe he wants them to be a surprise. - You can go now. [gentle bright music] [footsteps clicking] [gentle bright music] - [Franklin] Hey babe, what's up? Yeah, hi, honey. Did you send me flowers? - No, but don't think that I forgot 'cause I didn't. - What do you mean? - Our anniversary! - Oh yeah. I wondered if you remembered, you didn't say anything about it this morning. - Well, you didn't say anything either, so. - I see. - All right, don't work too late and I'll see you when you get home. I love you, babe, bye. - See you then, babe, bye. [slow mellow music] I'll be damned. [footsteps clacking] [keyboard clicking] [footsteps clacking] Jill, Jill, get here now! - What's wrong? Is it the advertising budget? 'Cause I can fix that. - No, look at these damn roses. Where did this blood come from? - Blood? The roses are fine. - And this is how you're gonna play me? - The roses are okay, there is nothing on them. - [Zoey] Fucking take these. - [Jill] Yeah, sure thing. - Have you heard anything about the cheating spouses turning up dead? - I've heard about them. Why are you worried? Is Franklin tipping around with another woman? - Yeah, maybe. - Maybe he sent the flowers out of guilt. Is that why you're giving them to me? - Yeah, that's it. [footsteps clacking] [slow eerie music] Hmm. [slow eerie music] [papers flutter] [slow eerie music] - Hi honey, welcome home. - Why is it so dark in here? Turn some damn lights on. [Franklin scoffs] - No, leave it dark. I like the dark. - What's wrong with you? - Are you forgetting? It's our anniversary. - Oh yeah, no, I didn't forget. - Yeah, so why don't you go get dressed? - What's wrong with this? - Well, it's a special occasion. I want you to look nice. Now, go upstairs and get dressed while I finished preparing our dinner. - Sure. [footsteps clacking] - Have you seen the wine opener? I can't find the wind opener. - It's in that drawer, over by the oven. - [Franklin] Okay, thank you. [footsteps clacking] [Zoey sighs] - I like the dark. [objects clang] Yeah, I might hate the dark, but at least I can't see his face. Can't come tonight, period. Wedding anniversary, period. See you tomorrow, period. [Zoey scoffs] [footsteps clacking] [cellphone buzzing] [water pattering] "Come play with me"? [fingernail clicking] What are you doing? Are you outside? - Yeah, I'm in my other car. - Are you crazy? - I was thinking about you. You know, I wouldn't mind a night cap. - I can't be with you right now. Anyway, I've, I've gotta go. - [Franklin] Hey sweetie, what's taking so long? - A client called. I'll be out in a minute. - [Franklin] Okay! - Don't ever, ever call here again. [cellphone thuds] [water patters] Black roses? [footsteps clacking] - Black symbolizes death. - So you're saying black roses are an acceptable representation of our marriage? - Death is inevitable. We're all going to die. For every day we spend, it's one day closer to death. We can't hide from death, but yet we should learn to embrace it. - Wow, can I have a knife to cut the bread? And maybe my throat with later? - Here's your knife. [knife clinks] Oh, by the way, I have a surprise for you. - Oh, yeah? What is that? - It's the neighbor's cat. I'm keeping the healthy one because the other one is sick. Would you hand me that cover that's, uh, laying there on the floor? I can get him to settle down a bit. [footsteps clacking] - You know I hate cats! [cat hisses and snarls] - It's nothing to be afraid of. - You know what [claps]? I've lost my appetite. I have a little bit of work that I have to do and then I'm going to bed. But, um, you and the cat enjoy the roses. [footsteps clacking] Happy anniversary. [soft instrumental music] - Did you get all your work done? - Yeah, for the time being. I can do the rest when I go to the office tomorrow. [soft instrumental music] [remote thuds] Stop it. - What's wrong, babe? - I'm not in the mood. [Franklin scoffs] - How long has it been? Been what? Since we've made love, had sex, fucked. - I don't know, maybe two weeks. [Franklin scoffs] - Well, obviously something's wrong. - No, I'm just stressed with work and [hand thuds] it's hard for me to perform when I'm exhausted. - Are you cheating on me? Because if you are, I really need to know. - No. Are you cheating on me? Because if you are, I need to know. - Zoey, since we've been together, I've never even desired to look at another woman. You're all I want. - Well, I'm glad we're on the same page. Can we go to sleep now? [blanket rustles] [deep ominous music] - Franklin? [Zoey cries and screams] [Zoey gasps and pants] [door creaks] [News Reporter] The gruesome remains of a female, - Hey. - [News Reporter] And male have. - Come in here and listen to this. - [News Reporter] In the woods, south of the city. The cause of their deaths are unknown. Dental records were used to make a positive ID and the deaths are now being ruled a homicide on the strength of a note found at the scene. The message, written in blood, states, "Cheaters are home-wreckers, who should pay for their sins." Authorities have confirmed both victims are married, but they are withholding the names of the victims... - This is bullshit. These people don't deserve to be murdered because they're fucking other people other than their spouse. - You think there's any truth to this? - It's just a hoax. Nobody believes this. And honestly, I don't wanna hear it. - It's not the first time I've heard this. This is like the third or fourth occurrence. So what? - So what? What? You're just gonna sit here and ignore it, pretend like this isn't happening? - So now what? You wanna break up with me because we're committing adultery? I knew I shouldn't have shown you that. - I'm concerned. - Do you really think that there's a serial killer that's gonna come in the middle of the night and murder us because we're running around on our partners? - I know it's far fetched, but that's what's happening. - First of all, there aren't that many cases. Secondly, for all we know this is gang violence, baby. - Well, that just means the odds are greater of them taking us out. - Taking, take us out? [Craig imitates throat slitting] Like whacked? What are we in, "The Sopranos"? - Come on, this is serious. - That person is stalking people because they're cheating, right? But there's no robbery, no rape, none of that involved. - That's what it sounds like. [door knocking] - [Zoey] Who is it? - Shh. - Don't shush me! - [Craig] Well, I don't see anybody. [Zoey sighs] - Okay, I think we have a really good thing going, but if you wanna break up with me, you need to do it now. [door knocks] [gentle eerie music] This wrong with you? Why are you so jumpy? - I don't wanna break up with you. I'm just afraid. - Well, we wouldn't be cheaters if we kill them. [deep ominous music] - What the hell just happened? - I don't know, there's construction, there's probably a wire. Wiring issue, whatever it is. - I mean, the lights are on outside. [gentle eerie music] - Ah, well, now they're back on. As I was saying, maybe we should kill Franklin and Veronica. [deep eerie music] - Okay, woman, this is crazy. You said kill twice, and both times you said that the lights went out. We gotta get outta here. [gentle eerie music] - As the kids would say, "How bizarre." - I wanna keep this discreet still, so I'm gonna go first. I parked further away. You can leave after me. - [scoffs] Just fucking go. [tense eerie music] [dogs barking] [car door thuds] [tense eerie music] - Damn it. What the hell? Get the hell off my car! Get the hell away from my car! Hey, what's for breakfast? - It's in the pot. - Jesus! Is something wrong with you? -You expect me to eat this crap? - Since when did you start calling my food crap? - When you started cooking shit like this. Are you deranged? - Are you? I just added some extra cheese. [gentle eerie music] - Oh, [lid clangs] I thought it was something else. [Craig sighs] What is that? - [Veronica] Is what? - That! - Craig, Are you okay? I mean, you're acting a little crazy. Is it because my dummy's over there? - No, I, I just, I thought it was something else. [Craig sighs] Nevermind. [tense ominous music] - [Veronica] How's the grits? - It's fine. Taste a lot better if I didn't have to stare at this damn thing. Better yet have it stare at me. - Darling, he's harmless. Besides, I'll just have to use him until we have a baby of our own. - Baby? I thought we agreed to quit trying. - We did, but I want a baby now. [electronic static] - What's that noise? - Oh, that's my new ringtone, I better go get it. [electronic static] [deep eerie music] Why haven't you finished eating? - I lost my appetite, the dummy's eyes were moving. - [chuckles] Don't be silly, he's harmless. - He looks pretty human to me. Anyway, I gotta go. [footsteps clacking] [doorknob rattles] [door thuds] [deep ominous music] - Craig, it's trying to kill me! - [Spirit] Me no kill you now. - [Zoey] Me? [Zoey yells] - [Spirit] Not yet. - Who are you? - [Spirit] I Spirit. - Where are you? - [Spirit] I everywhere. You no see? - No! - [Spirit] You no see? [Spirit chuckles] - No! [Zoey yells] - [Spirit] Running not help. [Zoey yells] - Oh my God! [Zoey yells] [gentle ominous music] - [Spirit] This one cheater. You cheater too. - I wanna live! I found a man I love. - [Spirit] You thief, you pay. - He loves me and we deserve to be together. - [Spirit] You kill husband. - No, I won't hurt him. - [Spirit] Yeah [chuckles]. I know better. - Stop it, leave me alone, please. - [Spirit] Punishment for you. [Zoey sobs] - [Spirit] You mine. [Zoey sobs] [Spirit chuckles] I come for you. - [gasps] Leave me alone. - You okay? - Hey, hey, what's wrong? - I think you were asleep. - I was. - And apparently dreaming about something called The Spirit. - Yeah? - My grandma told me all about spirits and she said if a spirit's after you, you better get your affairs in order. - What affair? [gentle upbeat music] Yeah. [gentle upbeat music] So do you know what today is? - I don't know. Is it your birthday? - No, it's silly. It's our one month anniversary. Can't believe you forgot. - I didn't forget, I remembered. I just wanted to see if you remembered. [Zoey giggles] Happy anniversary. - Happy anniversary. [lips smacking] [Craig chuckles] - Our other news, a married woman was found dead and her husband denies any involvement. The cause of death is yet to be determined. Once again, no DNA was left behind, but there was a note stating she was an adulterer. - Zoey, come on, we can't keep doing this. I mean, look at these people. They were cheating on their partners and now they're dead. We're gonna end up just like this. - You think too much. - No, I don't. I don't wanna end up dead like that though. Plus, we gotta think about our future. [shrill ominous music] - [Zoey] What the heck was that? - I don't know. [headboard thumping] - Huh, guess we're not doing it tonight. - [Craig] I don't know. I mean, we could try again. - Okay. [lips smacking] [shrill ominous music] [Zoey scoffs] [headboard thumping] All right, stay off of it for a moment. Let's see if there's something. Ow. - What happened? - Found my earring. [Zoey chuckles] See anything under there? - Uh, it's kinda dark. I think I feel something. [deep ominous music] - What's wrong? - [Craig] It's a hand! - A hand? - [Craig] And there's a human hand! Somebody was tortured here. Right there, on the floor. [deep foreboding music] - Baby, there's no hand there. Baby, there's no hand. [slow ominous music] Are you okay? - [Veronica] Hi baby. Hi baby. - Woman, are you extra peculiar? Why do you have this fake baby? I thought you got rid of it. - This is good practice for when we have our real baby, don't you think? - It doesn't matter what I think? - Maybe if I had a baby of my own, I wouldn't have to hold this baby doll. You're never here. - I gotta go, later. [footsteps thudding] [gentle sanguine music] [slow mischievous music] [shoe thuds] [slow mischievous music] [shoe thuds] [slow mischievous music] [cockroach buzzing] [bat clangs] - [Zoey] Craig? - [Craig] Huh? [slow mischievous music] Veronica? [gentle dramatic music] [door creaks] [slow mischievous music] I'm done. [door creaks] I'm done. I'm done. [slow mischievous music] [Craig exhales] [Craig yells] Get the fuck off! [upbeat mischievous music] [cockroach buzzing] [blows thudding] [cockroach squeaking] [blows thudding] Son of a bitch. Fuck with me! [door creaks] - Hi baby. [door creaks and thuds] Are you okay? - [Craig] Do you see anything on the floor right there? - There's a bat, I don't see anything other than that. Honey, [footsteps clacking] you look terrible. You're covered in sweat. [Craig panting] - Just a bad, a bad dream. [Craig panting] - You have a fever. [Craig panting] Uh, let me go get a towel or something. What? You want me to stay with you? Okay, I'm gonna be right next to you. Everything's okay, you're okay. I've got you. [lips smacking] [water pattering] [gentle whimsical music] [Zoey yells] - [Franklin] Relax, it's me. What do you think? - What are you, crazy? - Why are you such a baby? - You bring a real sword into my fucking shower! - [Franklin] It's not even real. Come on, lighten up. I think little Phillip's gonna love my costume. - Well, it looked real. - [Franklin] Come on, let's hurry up and go to the party. I don't wanna be late. I want some of that pizza. - Get out of here! Or I swear to God I'll kill you with that sword myself. This is all of it. - And he doesn't have any unknown kids that he's gonna share this with? - Nope, it's all left to me. - Damn, he must have really loved you. My wife only has about a 10th of this. - And that's why she still needs to die. We've already talked about this, you'd lose everything in a divorce. - [Craig] Where did all this blood come from? - I don't see any blood. - What the hell is going on? - Craig, I don't see any blood. [notepad thuds] There's no blood. [toilet paper rustles] [faucet hisses] [water sloshes] [shrill ominous music] - Shit, where's this blood coming from? Shit, shit, Zoey! Babe? - Yeah, what? - Can you come in here? - [Zoey] What's wrong? - What do you mean what's wrong? You, you don't see this? - No, what am I looking at? - You don't see all this blood? - No, what blood? - This blood, the blood that's everywhere. - No, it's not. - I don't understand you. You act like there's nothing wrong. - Because there isn't anything wrong. Look, I'm gonna get dressed and go home. There's no blood. [gentle ominous music] I've gotta go. [gentle ominous music] [footsteps clacking] Please proof these by the end of the day. - Yeah, sure. - [Dale] These mysterious killings are not. - What you watching? - There's been another body found, same MO. - Interesting statistic. Another couple has been found in an advanced state of decomposition. The cause of death is again unknown, but there remains resemble the bodies of the Spirit's Revenge victims. The police are working every possible lead, and there has even been a $250,000 reward offered for the arrest of the culprit or culprits involved. Dale, so far the detectives are dumbfounded. Do you have any advice for the public other than if you are cheating, you need to stop? - No, I think that pretty much covers it, Karla. I do wish they had a footnote to our story. I don't know if it's based on these mysterious killings or not, but there has been an increase in the amount of divorces filed recently. - Interesting statistic. - Yes it is. - When's it gonna stop? - Yeah, I've been seeing the stories on the news too. Are they closer to finding out who's responsible? - Based on what I've read, the police don't have a clue. And they're saying these deaths might not stop for a while. - Are you sure about that? - This is a serial killer, who smart enough to know how to not get caught. Interesting. It's a wake up call. People just need to stop cheating on their spouses. - Yeah, they do. - Do you know anyone who might be stepping out? - No one I know. I have to get back to work and so do you, Jill. [footsteps clacking] [shrill ominous music] Jill, get in here now. - What's wrong? - Who the hell has been in my office? - No one's been in here. - How did this get on my computer? - [Jill] What? That's the spreadsheet for the development project you've been working on. - That wasn't there a minute ago. Someone was in here. You know what? Tell the cleaning people they're fired. I'll clean my damn office myself, got that? - Got it, sorry about your computer. [keyboard clicking] [tense suspenseful music] - Stop it! [tense suspenseful music] - [Spirit] Zoey. - What's happening in here? - [Spirit] I back. - What do you want? - [Spirit] You pay for sins. - What sins? I haven't done anything wrong! - [Spirit] Try kill Franklin. - You've been spying on me? - [Spirit] I Spirit, I everywhere. - But I didn't do anything wrong. - [Spirit] Protect innocent people. - I swear I'm not gonna hurt anyone. - [Spirit] I leave now. You die soon. - Jill, what are you doing? - [Jill] Just working, do you need something? - No, no, no, I'm fine. I'm losing my fucking mind. [dog howls] [tense ominous music] - What the fuck? [shrill tense music] [car door rattles] [dogs howl and bark] Honey, I'm home. [door creaks] [door thuds] Honey? Good, I can get some work done. [Craig sighs] [zip hisses] Here we go. [laptop thuds] [keyboard clicks] [tense ominous music] [window thudding] [Craig yells] [shoes tapping] [Craig sighs] [keyboard clicking] What the fuck is this? [tense ominous music] "Traitor, why did you abandon your wife?" What? [tense ominous music] [fist thuds] Come on. [keyboard clicking] [laptop thuds] Fuck, damn it. [tense ominous music] - Oh, hi, hello to you too. [door thuds] - I'm so sorry, sweetie. I thought you might be someone else. - Who would I be? - It doesn't, doesn't matter. - How was your day? [Craig exhales] - Long, [sighs] but better now that your home. [Zoey giggles] - [Spirit] I here. - [Zoey] [gasps] What was that? [Zoey screams] Oh my God, did something touch me? - [Craig] What happened? What happened? - [Zoey] Get away! Get away from me! Craig, Craig, help me. [Zoey sobs] - See anybody? You didn't, they don't actually exist. - [sobs] No, I definitely did and it really frightened me. - You sure you just weren't under a lot of stress? - [sobs] No, it's gotta be that Spirit thing. - You know, a lot of crazy stuff's been happening to me too. - It could be my husband. [Zoey sniffles] - Maybe it could be my wife. - Maybe it's both of them. [footsteps clacking] - Zoey. - [Zoey] I'm taking a shower. [door creaks and thuds] [shrill ominous music] - You don't fucking scare me. [dog barks] [shrill ominous music] [dogs howl and barks] [door creaks] - Honey, was somebody outside the door? - No, it was just the wind. - Yeah, well, it sounded like something was howling out there. - Could have been the construction. - [sighs] I think we need to get our drink on. [Craig chuckles] - Yeah, that sounds good, okay. - Did you bring the ice? - It's in the car. Can't we just drink it like it is? - No, I'm not drinking warm Moscato. - Fine, I will go get it. - Thank you. - I'll bring right back. - I'm sorry. - Mm-hmm. [lips smack] - I'm gonna take a shower. - [Craig] Okay. - [Zoey] Holler if you need me. - [Craig] All right. [door creaks] - [Zoey] Craig, [giggles] is that you? I'm almost ready. [shrill suspenseful music] [Zoey gasps and screams] Oh my God! - Hey! [monster howls] Hey! Zoey, Zoey, open the door! [Zoey panting] What happened? What happened? Are you okay? - [Zoey] That thing, that thing, that I was really, I was seeing. It raped me. - [Craig] Get back inside. - [Zoey] It raped me. [Zoey panting] - Are you okay? You okay? [Zoey panting] - [Zoey] Baby, this place is haunted. [Zoey sobbing] [tense ominous music] [plate thuds] - Honey, do you want more wine? - We need to talk. - What's wrong? - I know that you know our relationship is going downhill. - Is it because you've been doing it with some hooker? - [sighs] Don't go blaming anybody else for this, I want a divorce. I plan on filing the papers. - [scoffs] What the fuck? - It's just not working and you know it. - How could you do this to me? - Stop! - I can't, I can't do this. - Veronica! [chair rattles] Veronica! [fist thuds] Veronica, open the door. We still need to talk. - [Veronica] I don't wanna talk you. Leave me alone. - Can we at least talk out here and finish our conversation? - [Veronica] No, we can't. - Veronica! [fists thud] - Don't worry about leaving me, I'll make it easy for you. [gentle somber music] Hope she's worth it. - [Craig] No! [gentle somber music] [Veronica sobs] - Oh God, I'm leaving, Craig. I'm never coming back. - Don't leave me, don't leave me. - You've proven that you don't want me. You'd rather be with somebody else. - I'm sorry. - You've proved to me that you don't want me. You wanna be with somebody else. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't want it to end this way. - It's time for me to go [sobs]. - [Craig] No! - And I finally get to meet my two babies in heaven, that I miscarried. I hope you enjoy you're life without me. - Veronica, no, don't leave me. Veronica, baby [sobs]! [gentle somber music] 911? My wife stabbed herself, Please send help! [deep tense music] - Cremate the body, bury the ashes, neat and fast. - Yeah, thanks, Lee. [Craig sighs] [Craig exhales] [footsteps clacking] What are you doing here? I told you I needed more time. - It's been four days. And look, I'm not, I'm not looking for that. I just wanna hold you and tell you everything's gonna be okay. - It's gonna take more time. - Well, when am I gonna see you again? - I don't know. I, I'll call you. [gentle plaintive music] - [Franklin] Zoey. [door thuds] Where were you? I've been trying to call you. [footsteps clacking] [glasses cling] [cupboard thuds] [glasses cling] [footsteps clacking] [chair rasps] [Zoey sighs] - I was at a memorial service. - A memorial service? I wish you would've told me, I could've gone with you. - No need. [wine glugs] It made me realize that life is short, [wine glugs] We need to enjoy it while we still can. - We should all be prepared for death. - You never know when it's gonna happen. [tense ominous music] - Thanks, I thought you saved this for special occasions. [wine glugs] - It is a special occasion, it's the rest of your life. [bottle thuds] [tense ominous music] Meet me upstairs in the bedroom, after you take one of your little blue pills. [footsteps clacking] Take two. [footsteps clacking] [Zoey and Franklin moaning] [Zoey and Franklin panting] - I think that was the best sex we've ever had. - Always save best for last, baby. - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh, nothing, it's just the wine talking. - That wine sure got you in the mood. - Uh-huh, speaking of, time for round two. I'll be back. [bright spirited music] [Zoey chuckles] [bright spirited music] [sighs] Just let me know when you're ready for round two, babe. - I'm always ready for you. I feel like I'm getting hard already, again. - Let me put on some love-making music. [Franklin groans] ♪ I wonder why I ♪ ♪ I feel so ♪ - What you think? Oh, hmm, you went to sleep? Or should I really say, rest in peace? [soft jazz music] Yep, I'm sorry, Franklin. [pills rattle] ♪ Hurt so bad ♪ - Since this music is so loud, [pills rattle] I didn't hear you die. And if the cops ask why I didn't wake up, Well, I guess I just took too many Valium. Now which one's mine again? Oh, yeah. ♪ All the pain I've been through ♪ - Don't wanna mix those up. ♪ Put on my happy face ♪ ♪ That's what I've learned to do ♪ ♪ People think ♪ ♪ There's peace in my mind ♪ ♪ If they only knew ♪ ♪ I'm alone ♪ - Ah, that's a shame. ♪ In the dark ♪ - See you in the morning. [somber jazz music] [hand thuds] Sorry, Franklin. [sheets rustle] [Zoey groans] [Zoey breathes heavily] I guess it's time to make that call. [nails clicking] Yes, help, hi, I need help. My husband, he's not breathing! Please! Please! [Zoey sobs] [Zoey sighs] - Yeah, he's definitely dead. What happened to him? - He took Viagra, we had sex, I took Valium, and we were drinking last night, and when I woke up, he was like this. - Some of these men need to stay off that pill. [Zoey sighs] - Well, my partner's are little insensitive. - All right, we need to call this in. [footsteps shuffle] - What's the emergency? - Franklin's dead. - What? What happened? - Well, he took a Viagra, we had sex, went to bed, woke up and he was laying there dead. - Jesus, I'm so sorry to hear. If there's anything I could do, let me know. - I'll be fine, I need a little bit of space, you know, funeral arrangements and all. - Yeah, well, I'll be waiting. I'll leave first. - Okay. [footsteps rustle] [cellphone buzzes] Hello? - [Spirit] You pay for sin. - Who is this? - [Spirit] You next. - Who is this? Is this Death again? - [Spirit] Adulterers must die. - I'm telling you the truth. I didn't do anything, okay? - [Spirit] You pay for sin. - Who is this? Why are you calling me? I don't give a shit! [indistinct chatter] - Should we get something to eat? - I'm good. - I totally get it, it's so sad though. - [Memorial Attendee] Hey. - [Zoey] Hey. - [Memorial Attendee] I'm so sorry for what happened. - [Zoey] Yeah, it was, it was sudden. - [Memorial Attendee] Yeah, so crazy. You know, I feel like he was so active the other day. - [Zoey] I know, but, you know, who could have seen that happening? I'm gonna go check how things are in the kitchen. I'll be back though. - [Memorial Attendee] Okay. - [Zoey's neighbor] It's really sad though. [indistinct chatter] - It was a very nice service. - Thank you for coming. [Zoey sobs] - Again, I'm so sorry for your loss. If you can't come into work for a while, I understand. And I'm more than willing to pick up the slack. - I appreciate that, Jill, thank you. [footsteps clacking] - Zoey. - Thank you for coming over. - Not many neighbors are willing to babysit your cat for you. Franklin was a saint and I just hope he didn't suffer too long. - Oh, he didn't suffer long at all. - Okay. - Again, thank you for coming over. - Oh, of course, of course. And if there's anything you need, please be sure... - Bye guys, thank you for coming. [shrill ominous music] [cellphone ringing] [shrill ominous music] Stop calling me, Death! [shrill ominous music] [cellphone buzzes] [shrill ominous music] Delete! Delete, damn it! [Zoey yells] [cellphone thuds] [tense ominous music] [footsteps clacking] - [Spirit] Zoey. - Now what? [tense ominous music] [object rustles] - [Spirit] Zoey. [footsteps clacking] Zoey! [tense ominous music] [footsteps clacking] I back! This ends now! [footsteps clacking] [tense ominous music] [water pattering] [footsteps clacking] - [Spirit] You pay for sins. [tense ominous music] [doorbell chimes] [Zoey yells] [Zoey sighs] [footsteps clacking] [tense ominous music] [footsteps clacking] What the hell is going on? [Zoey yells] [door thuds] [tense ominous music] Who are you and what are you doing in my house? - [Spirit] You killed. I know what you did, no accident. - Get out of my house now! [Zoey grunts] - [Spirit] No hurt me. I already dead. - I don't know who you are, but you are gonna tell me. - [Spirit] I Death, I kill cheaters. - You killed those people. - [Spirit] Every one. - Why? - [Spirit] They evil, unfaithful killers like you. - I love Craig and he loves me. - [Spirit] He love me too. - What do you mean by that? - [Spirit] He love me too. - What does that have to do with me? - [Spirit] I want life. - You can't have Craig. - [Spirit] Want Craig. Your time done. You die now. [flames fluttering] I will have Craig for myself. He endured his trials and did not sacrifice his wife. We will be married and I will have the babies I was intended to birth before I was killed by my husband and his murderous whore. Your time is done. [gentle morose music] [doorbell chimes] [gentle romantic music] [Craig chuckles] - What, did you join a monastery? - [chuckles] Just wrapping this gift for you. [Craig and Zoey chuckle] Hi. - [Craig] Good to see you. [Zoe moans] [lip smacking] - Come on in. - [Craig] Okay. Oh, I love the place. - [Zoey] Oh yeah? Wait till you see the bedroom. [chuckles] But first, have a seat. - All right, well, you seem different. - Better or worse? - Better. I don't know what it is, but it's like you see more alive. You have a burden lifted off your shoulders or something? [Zoey chuckles] - Yes, things are less stressful now. - I like your hair too. - Thanks. I changed it for you. [gentle romantic music] [Zoey chuckles] [gentle romantic music] [lips smacking] [gentle romantic music] [gentle ominous music] [upbeat dramatic music] - [Spirit] Hm, black roses my favorite. I am going to have to stop drinking at these things. [Spirit retches]
