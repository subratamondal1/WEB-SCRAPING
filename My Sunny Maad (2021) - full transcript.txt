An Afghan bride isn't allowed to smile. Otherwise, she'd look too eager for her wedding night. It seemed strange to me. Like many other customs I was just hearing about. Shortly before as an Economics student in Prague I'd felt I didn't belong anywhere. My mother had a new husband and wasn't terribly interested in me. I didn't know my father. That might be why I wanted a forever relationship. But Czech boys were awful. Selfish, indecisive idiots. Then, Nazir showed up. I knew right away he was the One. Everyone warned me. You don't know what you're getting yourself into. He'll throw a burka on you and lock you up to make babies. But that's what I was looking forward to. A large family with children. Nothing was keeping me in Prague, so two months later we left for Kabul. We got married three days later. I went from being Helena to Herra. I had lost my virginity a long time ago, which Nazir hadn't expected. And I hadn't expected that not being a virgin could be life-threatening. Nazir always boasted about tracing his family tree back five generations. His father had been killed fighting the Taliban. His brother, too. His mother still mourned them. Otherwise she was a typical mother-in-law. Cut it properly. Nazir likes it that way. Mighty Allah! Let me do it. Nazir's sister, Freshta, had four children. So I tried to help out. You can't even change his diaper. If this is what you guys do, we don't. It's because you don't have your own kids. Freshta's daughter, Roshangol, was like all girls her age all over the world. Rustam! Kamal! Freshta's husband, Kaiz, sold chickens at the market. He bought them nearly dead, cleaned them up and sold them. Grandpa was the nicest. I would sit with him for hours. He taught me Dari, and I translated the news for him. The Americans made a tragic mistake and bombed a NATO base. What? Again? What kind of pilots do they have? Nazir couldn't find a job. He tried different embassies, but no one needed an Afghan economist. Nazir's mother told me on Day One: pork and sinful thoughts are forbidden. Otherwise, you're absolutely free. And she was right. If a woman didn't want to be attractive to anyone but her husband, she'd be very happy in an Afghan family. This will definitely help. You'll see. Aunt Aziza got pregnant right away. Nazir, you have to do it like this! Off to bed! And you finish your drink. It's making me sick. It'll work, you'll see. May Allah bless your actions. This is useless. It'd be best if Nazir found a second wife. With a healthy womb. Just for making babies. It upset us both, but I felt guilty. Nazir tried to make me as happy as he could. Pick something already. Like these perhaps. I don't have a green one. Just hurry up though. Oh well. You got nice, plump tits. How about your cunt? Next time I'll kill you. Whore! What? It didn't really surprise me that the men saw Western women as whores. An old VHS of Basic Instinct was circulating around Kabul. Move! Get away. You hear me? Hm, you see. perhaps you'll lose weight. Maybe. Wow! It'd look better on you. Take it off at once! You won't wear that trash around decent people. - But she looks nice. - She looks like a whore. She'd get groped around the first corner. By who? I can't even go near the window. Because I won't let you live like them. Quiet! Kaiz, my boy, in this house the only ones who can shout are me and my grandson. Go make a scene at your own father's home. And Roshangol will finally go to school. Just like her brothers. As long as I'm alive, women in this family will be respected. - Finally. - Aunt Nafissa. His name is Muhammad. He has no one. My son found him on the road. They say you can't have children, so I thought you won't mind if he looks a bit strange. what? But I ... He's very clever and sensitive. He's even been to school. You'll get used to him. You'll see. I don't know. It won't trouble you. You're well off. We're family after all. Well... He doesn't eat much. I don't think he'll live long anyway. That's enough! Go away! He has a strange head. Like a lightbulb. Each of us is unique. There is one thing though. Maad, stand up. Mighty Allah! He isn't even circumcised! Isn't he missing something? The poor little guy has them inverted. You damned women! Get out! What's your name, boy? Mohammad. You have the prophet's name. It's a gift. Don't be afraid. Nobody is perfect. And Allah surely has a reason for sending us the child. We should all be grateful for this sign. I snore sometimes, but you'll get used to it. I wet my bed sometimes. I don't want to ruin it. That's ok. We'll wash it. I always wash my own stuff. You see? We have a son. I'm a little scared. Nonsense. He's a good boy. He's sick. His muscles are atrophying. He won't live long. No, it's Czech. I'm from Czechia. In Europe. What's it like there? The nature, the towns... People go to the cinema, for a beer. And women don't wear burkas. I'd like to see that. Would you like to go to Europe, too? This is my dream, boy. The birthplace of your namesake, Mohammad. Look. I got a job! I'll be driving for the Americans. Zhulgai recommended me. Great! Maad! - We're going on a trip. - Yay! Look! It used to be the greatest pride of Kabul. But that was a long timo ago. -Take that! - Leave them alone. Look! It's your brothers, Maad. Marjan. He's a beauty, isn't he? But he's blind. One Mujahadeen once made a bet to pet him. But the lioness got mad and bit his head off. Two days later, his brother threw in a grenade at it. But he's still beautiful. And he didn't give up. Like us. And where’s Maad? Maad? - He was just here. - Maad! Maad! Maad! - Maad? - Where are you? - Maad! - Maad? Maad! Maad? Nazir invited his employers from the humanitarian base to our house. We had no idea how life changing this visit would be. Zhulgai drove them over. Nazir's friend from war times. Where can I sit? Thank you. Welcome to our house. It's really beautiful here. On a hill with a great view. I was angry. Nazir simply denied my existence. That's how it's done around here. Afghan women are hidden from visitors, so strangers can't see them. I hope you'll be happy with my grandson's work. He's an honest man. If it weren't for him, we'd all die of hunger. Of course. We're very happy with him. Our family has always been progressive. I worked all my life as a photographer in the city center. Really? This must be young Nazir. Of course! And this is Zhulgai. The third one is my brother. He didn't make it. Back then we believed that if we won, things would get better. And didn't they? It depends how you look at it. And where are your women? At work? They're ill at the moment. Relatives are taking care of them. That's right. Our women also used to wear skirts and go to the cinema. - Unbelievable. - That's in Kabul? -	It was a completely different world. - Hm, sure was. A completely different world. Hold up. The girl's name is Heidi. An American. Grandpa's staring at her boobs. Mighty Allah! She'll end up on his lap! Let me see. And what about him? He's quite handsome. I want to see, too. You have a European woman here? That’s Nazir's wife. And why are you hiding her? I'm Heidi. Herra. Our guests accepted we had suddenly got better and had slipped into the next room. But our husbands didn't take the humiliation so lightly. Kaiz! Mighty Allah, leave her alone! It's not her fault. I made her watch! Kaiz! Asshole! What do you think you're doing? Hit him from the other side, so it pops back in place! Thank Allah you have such a nice husband. And be nice to him this evening. Good night. Did you know my uncle chopped his wife's head open for speaking in front of guests? - And did he go to prison? - No. It was his wife, not someone else's. And his relatives didn't do anything? Why? They were his. She married into it. Don't be angry with me. For me, it's also humiliating. Locked up in a closet. Here, wives obey their husbands. Don't talk to anyone. I'll pick you up on my way back from the market. This is Roshangol, your new classmate. You can take that off. No men are allowed in here. Her father forbids it. That's ridiculous. She can't be covered during class. - I'll go - No! get him. No, please don’t go! Boys, go play outside. Wait. A little to the right. Yea! Turn towards me. And now. Good! What's wrong with your lip? It's as big as a camel's. Kaiz caught her wearing lipstick, so she got a beating. I can't go to school now without an escort. But who would take me? I'll be stupid forever. Kaiz already chose her a husband. His uncle's son. Not in a milion years! He's nearly 40! That's not right. She's still a child. He's waiting for her first period. I won't get married. I'd rather run away. I'll take you to school. Aw you mad? Everyone will laugh at me. I'II wear a burka. There we go! I'm invisible! You're a genius! That boy will be president one day. I'm invisible! See? Maad's gone mad! But I love him! I'd marry you right now! I bought two pots and a new head scarf for both of you. Come on. They'll give you 400 dollars. The Americans. I found you a job. They want you to work with us. Some charity work for women. I bought you this so you'd have something to wear. Unwrap it. Fifty dollars. But I beat it down to forty-six. They're rubber. You can roll around in puddles and not get wet. You look good. Great. The Americans will be stunned. And they were stunned. How's it going, Zhulgai? Not running again? Shitty American-made car parts. - A mess as far as the eye can see. - Of course. Yes? We're here. She speaks English and French, and just needs to be told what to do. We'll explain it to her of course, Nazir. Could you first write your resume for us? Sure, but can't she write it at home? Nazir, can't your wife speak for herself? Why don't you go help Zhulgai? Nazir? Don’t speak to him. How can you stand this? I guess I'm used to it. We opened our first gynecological clinic. But women are afraid to come. You could help explain they matter, too and don't have to hide under a rag. I wear it sometimes, too. Then you should stop. Haven't men ever tried to grope you between the legs here? Yes. But what does that have to do with it? We're trying to help them feel normal, but I'd be running around Kabul in that rag? They're horny. The only women they see are from their own family. You can at least hide a little in a burka. And people won't call you a whore. I'll go for your contract. Even though I'm not sure it's a good idea. It's ok. She takes it too seriously. They caught Osama! - What? - It's all over the TV. You were here alone with a man? Yes. Because I work with him. Well that's good news! Speak for yourself. Breaking news. - Look! - Quiet! Look at his eyes. And also a real son of a bitch. Two of their buildings fall and they cry like little babies. If something like that happened in Kabul, no one would notice. That's New York! But what those boys did smart thinking. I bet they were trained somewhere here. The Americans must have been surprised. They were idiots. But they must have died though, too. I hope they weren't Afghans. I feel sorry for the Americans, too. They tremble whenever they see a plane. There's no worse place in the world than Kabul. Roshan! Roshangol! Where have you been? You're supposed to be looking after me. Stop it, Roshan. You got away from me again. Where were you? Chickens! Oh no, my father. Run! Best chickens in Kabul! Buy my chickens. Go. Quickly! Are you joking? Kids back home learn about this in preschool. Someone from the Sharia court will come and put us all in jail. Did a camel bite it off? You're an idiot. Why did you put this here? The women won't like it. We'll see. I still don't understand how you can stay sane with all this. Sometimes I think the same. Before I came here, my life seemed so complicated. l didn't know how to handle it. Everything here is simple. One husband, one religion, one country. Well, it seems complicated enough to me. Here! Have some gum. Thanks. Times are changing. The Americans won't be here forever. Join us, before it's too late. I said I won't do that. You used to be a different kind of hero. Hi, Nazir. Careful. You're putting on weight. Herra was just telling me she likes slim men. - You've been smoking! - Are you crazy? I hate that. You're lying! They taught you to lie. How can I know you're not just fucking there? I was just holding Heidi's cigarette. What are you doing to me? What are you doing? And here. Wait, wait. - Yes. - Your turn. They accidentally killed 5 people again. What kind of pilots do you have? They don't care who they kill. As long as there's something to shoot. - That's bullshit. - What's bullshit? -	Just play. -	It's not my turn. Look what I've got. You're cheating! You're all cheating. Go to hell! Oh well. You're an adult now. It's time to get married. I don't want to marry him. Please, don't. You know I don't want to marry him. Please! I decide. Not you. I know what's best for you. Come on. This is Freshta. My sister-in-law. Hello. Here you are. Don't worry. The nurse will examine you. Don't be afraid. She get infected somehow, but it's nothing serious. Infected? From where? I don't know. Probably her husband. Bring her for a checkup in a week. Thank you. I look forward to seeing you again. What are you staring at? You haven't forgotten. So, step on it! -Abdul! - Nazir! Keep him away! Keep him by the car! What are you guys doing? Tell him who I am. We're here to pick up medicines. They're expecting us. Ok, madam. Are you registered? Of course. Do that again and you can stay here with them. They don't know you're my husband. They think you're just the driver. Who's home is this? Ours or yours? This is my home, too! If they told you to stick out your ass, you'd do it! Just like all Western women! - You know I'm not like that. - I don't know what you're like! You've changed. So have you. What we're gonna do is the car and driver stay here. And you'll come in our car. He's my husband. We both have the same ID. I don't care. Tell him you can't go inside without me. Sir, please. I also have my rules. I can't go without an escort. That's not possible. He would need a special permit. So, can I go? Get out. Your driver seems a bit nervous. Should we detain him? No. It's alright. Hey, pass the ball. - Are you Czech? - You too? What are you doing here? Well I live here. And what's it like? Great. - Good luck. - Bye. Bye! Ok, thanks. We can go now. You took off your head scarf to look like them. - Ouch! - Leave him alone. Kaiz, what are you doing to him? He was taking whorish photos of her. If it got out, the wedding would be over. So what? She doesn't want him anyway. Herra! This is none of your business. You have a beautiful daughter. You should be proud. You'll never understand a father's love because your wife's barren. You should at least honor the Quran. You should honor him. He feeds us all. Allah will punish you for ruining her like this. Who do you think Allah made better? Women or men? Women. my boy. Adam came first, and whenever you make it for the first time, it's never perfect. A woman is immortal because she lives on in her children. But a man can protect his wife and children. She must respect him for that and make his short time here as nice as possible. Our limited time. Fresh water! Fresh water! Who wants a drink? There you go. Don't worry. There's plenty for everyone. Fresh water. Our help is for free. That's all I have. Could you send my daughter to Europe? She's very smart and wants to study. I'm afraid I canlt help you. Her siblings will then go. I'd die happy. How did you get here? Kaiz let you come? Not quite. He's in Jalalabad for three days. If we don't find her by then, I'll kill myself. Who? Roshangol ran away from home. I went to wake her this morning and she was gone. He's going to kill me. And if he finds her, he'll kill her, too. She can stay with us for a few days. She can't sleep out of the house. That would be the end. You'd rather die than do something about it. Have Zhulgai drive. Try to find her. But where should we look? I'd try the Hazars in Charikar. Why there? We don't even have relatives there. We do. But I haven't seen them in a long time. I lost her a few times on our way from school. But just for a while. I once told her about the Hazars. Part of my family lives there. - So you planned it all with her. - No. I would never think of that. You'd better wait here. All that talk about freedom and now our daughters run away and whore around. Why should she whore around right away? Because old rules don't apply anymore. They watch TV and read filthy American magazines. Filth everywhere you look. We didn't spill Islamic blood for this Western bullshit. But they're giving you a job. You want the Taliban to return to power? You know nothing. You don't even care you're driving around with a stranger. I wonder what Nazir will say. Probably nothing. He's always kissing the West's ass. What? Roshan is fine. But we won't see her again. She's in Bamian. But you can't tell anyone. Not even Nazir. Otherwise they'd find her and that would be it. We asked all over Charikar, but no news. So, I'll never see her again. Mighty Allah... If I knew where she was, I'd go and strangle her. She's shamed us all. Oh please. Stop it. She had her first period and knew it was over for her. If I were in her shoes, I'd run too. Yes, we remember that well my child. You loved Kaiz so much that you'd have killed yourself if you hadn't got him. And when we tried to stop you, you simply ran away with him We are left helpless when even our own children leave us. Who did we visit today? That was my mother. And your father? I've never met him. He was probably a real asshole. I don't know. My mother's new husband didn't like me. He thought I was a demon. So, he hit me. I am God's vengeance. I'll never be a real Afghan woman, either. She'd rather die than not have children. But see. That's why God gave me you. You were riding in a car with a man. But it was Zhulgai. Sorry, I won't do it again. Yes, you will. You'll do even worse things. Over here! I sold twenty chickens. Half dead, but no one could tell. Thank you. It's beautiful. I'll say! And this, too. So nobody can say I don't take care of my family. The nicest gift is for the bride. Where is Roshangol? Where's Roshangol? Is she studying again, or what? She isn't. She ran away. - What? - She's not studying. She ran away! What do you mean "ran away"? She just ran away! Disappeared! Mom! This is your fault. You sent her away because you think I'm a bad father and husband. She left on her own. We looked for her everywhere. Herra, why did she do it? Maybe she didn't want to marry someone like you. Get the kids. We're going to my parent's house. Go by yourself. I'm not going anywhere. You won't be missed here, my son. What's going on? I'd like to help Freshta. To get her out of the horror she's living. I could marry her and take her to Europe. The children, too. Freshta, I'm serious. Have you gone mad? Kaiz will find you and slit your throats. Have you any idea the mess it'd bring? Should I wait for him to kill me? You have to help us. Me? Never. I disagree with all this. She can get divorced. Then she can get out of here, legally. I want the best for her. Maybe it's possible in theory, but her husband will take the kids. Everything's different here. Haven't you noticed? I'll try to arrange the passports. You remember what to do with this, right? Just hide it on the base and let it do the rest. They'll let you in. No fucking way. Brother, I like your family. And you, too. I would be sorry to see you all die. See this as an opportunity. What? Get lost. What's this about? It's always a pleasure when you pay us a visit. Your dear son, Kaiz, is my son as well. I'm glad to hear that your whole family is in good health. We thank Mah every day. We are grateful for your hospitality. Let me also inquire about your family's health. You are kind. Allah has also blessed us with good health and nothing troubles us. The children of a shamed wife belong to the father's family. That is the law. We would like to take both the boys. The boys are happy here. Their school is close by. There's also a school where we live, and the teachers are just as good. Whatever you take with you now is forever yours. Whatever it may be. Mighty Allah. Are they taking them to that damp block of flats? Sixteen people in one flat. No running water for years. You're not going to say goodbye? No. And where's little Junes? Leave him with his mother. She's still nursing him. That is the law. If you don't want us to report that our granddaughter ran away because you didn't raise her well, so we'll take Junus and say goodbye. Kaiz, bring him. Don't do this. It will hurt the child you love as much as we do. We aren't happy with the way you raise the children. We won't let anything shame our family like this again. You let the kids watch banned films. Junus's mother mingles with foreigners and Herra works with Europeans wearing shorts all day, unsupervised. Maybe we could leave him here for a little longer. Not a day longer. You are leaving this house with all your children! This won't bring you happiness. Only pain. You can't do this! They're happiest here. Can't you see? Nazir, your wife has no right. She may have no right, but she is right. Do something if you want your children to respect you. Mommy! Mommy! I'll always be with you. You're the most precious things I have. Let's go. Sister? This breaks my heart. This was judgement day. That's how I picture it. Hopefully, the worst is over. Do you know what's my biggest advantage? You have plenty of advantages, Maad. The biggest one is that nobody wants me. Except for you. You're leaving? - Be careful, son. - See you tonight. What on earth? Did the Americans miss again? Where's Nazir? Don't go over there. Grandpa cried all evening. Mother dressed me in black and we smoked two hashish cigarettes together. The next few days I just lay in bed wanting to die. The flight for Frankfurt is now boarding. Will you write? Freshta? Madam? Madam. Your passport, please. What's going on? - We're going with them. - What do you mean? You wanted to go to Europe, didn't you? What are you talking about? I don't. Maad, I can't handle it here on my own. What do you mean, alone? I'm nothing? What about grandma and grandpa? Are you gonna run away and leave them here to die? Aunt Nafissa will look after them. - I'm not going anywhere! - We can come visit. Meed! The flight for Frankfurt is now boarding. I would die here without you. Let's go home then, shall we?
