It wasn't long before he was taken away from me. I, I hit rock bottom and was left to figure it all out. (police sirens) Now I'm here. It's been five years since my husband's been gone. I spent all of our savings. I lost my salon too. So here I am back renting one and I can barely afford that. - [Terry] Hey mommy. - [Lena] That's Terry. So tired. She's my closest friend. I've known her for a while now. She's been helping with all of this. You know what? I think I'm gonna run out and get something to eat. That's what I'ma do. - Yes.

Here put your number in there. - What is it, Black? Right? I don't know you. Okay. And honestly, to know me is to know food is not gonna get you my phone number. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I was raised to give a woman what she want. Look, I run the South side and pretty soon I be running the whole city. Yeah. They call me Black. But since you won't give me your number, just take mine. How that sound? Don't think too long.

So man, I feel like these calls are getting shorter and shorter. - About a year to go, right? - [Lena] Yeah. I miss my baby and Miles needs his father. But he did say he might get released a little early. So I'm hoping, please. - Nice. I know you happy. - It's just, it's just so hard without him, you know? I just want my old life back. - I know. I know you do. And that means a new location, ma'am? - Oh yeah. A new place. A new life. A new everything. - Right. - Okay. - You deserve it. Oh, before I forget, I gotta shoot out. I gotta go handle some stuff. So. - You gotta leave earlier again, Terry? I better not catch you on them streets, twerking and stuff. (Terry laughs) Be like, Hey a a a a. - I'm not. Whatever girl.

I'll be ready. Later. (laughs) Oh. Mm. Mm mm mm. (hip hop music plays) - I got this. Of course. Anything for you. - Wow. This is nice. - Yeah. I figured you would like this place. - How you figure that? - Cause I'm dealing with somebody with class and taste. It's the way I like it. - You right. I know him over there. - Oh yeah. Heavy. - He actually used to work with my husband back in the day. - Yeah. Me and Chris both worked for Heavy. - What, what, what did you just say? - Me and your husband. Both worked for Heavy. - No, no, no. I heard what you said. Like what the fuck? - Calm down. We are in public. I didn't think it was a big deal. - Oh. - Don't look like that. - Ah. - Don't make that face. I ain't gotta be in your life long. I know where your husband is. And by the looks of it you too damn fine to be stressing about anything. If you really want me gone after this is all over, I'll be done out your life. That's your call. But in the meantime, I said in the meantime. You see him? That's our key. How well you know him? - I mean, we used to go to school back in the day. - See, that's exactly what I'm talking about. History. That's the easiest way to get what you want outta somebody. I bet he trust you too. - What are you implying? - I don't think you understand what I'm trying to tell you. Look, we gotta strategize, right? - I. - Because you tired of struggling. I don't wanna see you struggle. You just wanna win. And with me you will always win. I got a plan. Yeah. Let's get outta here. Let's make moves. Fix your face. I got a plan. - What was it about him? I mean, everything in me told me not to trust him and there I was falling in love. He was right though. I had been down so long. I just wanted to win again. I wanted to be on top. - Come on. Come on. Lead the way. So you have fun tonight or what? - I wish I would've known we were only gonna be there for five minutes. I wouldn't have worn this dress or these damn heels. - Stop complaining. Don't complain. I like it. I love to look at you in that dress. - I bet you do. - You right about that. - So. What's the history between you and my husband? - Me and Chris. We like brothers. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. We both worked for Heavy, but it was Chris that showed me everything I know. To be honest, me and Heavy really ain't see eye to eye and I figured why work for somebody else and take orders if all you really need is you. So I left his organization. Ain't nothing. - And why y'all don't speak anymore? - I mean, to be honest, I came here to spend time with you. I ain't come here to talk about Heavy all night. Where Miles? - Miles is at his grandparents. Hm. That boy keeps his mama going. - Right. I see it. - You know, I don't believe in messing with my husband's friends. - I understand that. But you know what else? I think you should stop saying what you won't do. Cause you told me you wasn't gonna, you told me you wasn't gonna call me, right? (Lena laughs) And yet I'm here, sitting right in your living room. - Yeah. But that's not cuz I wanted to. - Exactly. That's what I mean, you did what you had to do. Don't apologize for doing what you gotta do to survive and take care of your family, right? Not supposed to be like that. But look though. From the looks of it, I wouldn't guess you was missing a thing. So we staying out here all night or you gonna gimme a tour? (kissing sounds) You lead the way. - You ready for this? - Of course. I'm ready. (hip hop music playing) Hope you got a plan B. Talkin' about you don't think I can handle it. - Good morning. - Good morning. (kissing sounds) - Last night was fun. - Indeed it was. - Oh man. So babe. - Yeah? - You was talking about a plan last night. What's the plan? - Yeah, Heavy. He's our plan. - What does Heavy have to do with our plan? - I want you to go back to that club tomorrow night. I want you to talk to Heavy. Tell him you need 100K for Chris while he locked up. - What? 100k? - Yeah. - I'm not doing that shit. No. Heavy is crazy. If he finds out, he'll kill me. - Relax. He ain't killing nobody. It's free money. We gonna take that money and make more money. That is what you wanted, right? - I mean, yeah, but I don't have a good feeling about this at all. And it, Heavy's not somebody you just roll up on and have a conversation with. - Nah, see. Heavy will always let an old friend get near him. I mean, Chris was Heavy's prize possession back in the day. He did the most numbers for him. When he see you, he'll feel obligated. Don't worry about it. - I, I don't know. I don't know about that. - He trust you, but I need you to trust me. All right? (smooches) It's gonna be okay. In this together. Ain't nobody got you like I got you. (church music playing) (Terry sobbing) - You're early. You know, service isn't until Sunday. - This is the only place that really reminds me of her. - Yeah. Your grandmother was a great woman, Terry. She loved God and this church. - I'm just trying to make sense of this all. - Well, you see that's the thing because sometimes God does things that we don't always understand. - She was on the floor for hours. No one knew. I'd been saying that I was gonna go by and see her. But I was just so caught up with what I had going on that. - Listen Terry. You've got to forgive yourself too. I mean a heart attack is very unpredictable. How could you know? - If it wasn't for her night nurse she would've been laying there still waiting for me to come home. - Your grandmother knew that you loved her. So don't question that and certainly don't question God. This is what you really need to ask yourself. What's really stopping you from coming home now? Hmm? Look. Tell you what. Whenever you're ready, you'll have all the support here. We'll be here. Better yet, He'll be here too. ♪ But I'll always be with you, baby ♪ - Can I help you? - Uh, I'm here to see Heavy. - And you are? - He knows who I am. - Yeah, she's straight. She's straight.

Hope that doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. - Nah, actually my ex-boyfriend's currently locked up and you know, I used to work for him, but he's gonna be away for a long time. So it's all good. Yeah. - So what he's in for? - Trafficking, robberies, he did whatever he needed to do to put food on the table. - Wait a minute, what? - [Terry] What? - Girl you never told me that. - I mean, it's not something I'm necessarily proud of, but a girl's gotta eat though.

(Lena chuckles) I wanna thank you for dinner last night. Oh man, that food was amazing. - I try. - Ah, you do more than try. It was also good to catch up with Black. Man, we haven't talked for years. I mean, you know, he put some money in my books and sent the occasional message to me through some of the guys in the yard. But, I think last night we got back to where we belong. - Babe uh. I just want you to know that life got really lonely without you. I mean, it was just me and Miles. And I felt like my whole world was caving in. One moment I have everything. And then the next moment it just was gone in a flash. I mean, I'm even back to renting my shop now. I don't know. I, I just, I feel like somewhere in between, somewhere in between, I fell outta love. - Baby, I don't want you to ever think that I don't understand what you've been through. I'm thankful for every visit, for every call. I missed you and Miles so much. But now that I'm back, I gotta figure out how to get us back to where we were. But I'm out the game. I ain't doing that shit no more. I'm not going back inside. I'm not doing anything to separate me from my family. - Chris, I. - Lena. Look, you gotta trust me. You gotta let me handle this. Okay? Look. I got something for you. (laughs) - What is that? - See. - That's beautiful. - When I was locked up, I was in the Penn. - Mhm. - Every Sunday, this preacher would come to the stop, right? - Uh-huh. - He would come. He would talk to us. He would always say, "Jesus, keep me near the cross." And I was like, "What the hell does that mean?" He said, "I can't teach you how to find God. But in time of trouble and hard times, God would find you." So when I was locked up and I was going through it and I was missing you and Miles. That kept me sane. It kept me alive. You kept me alive. I want you to have it. - Thank you, babe. (kissing sound) - Love you. - I love you more. - I'm hungry. - You know what I was thinking too? - What? - Remember last night at the dinner, when Terry was talking all that stuff about her ex-boyfriend and the robberies? I was like, what in the hell? - Yo. That was crazy. - In all my years. Nah, seriously. In all my years I've known her, I've never heard that. - Really? - No I didn't, I. Not a peep from her about anything like that. Crazy, right? - Man, you could know somebody for a long time. - A long time. - Not really know them. Life is crazy like that. Cheers to us.

How you doing? - What are you doing here? - Take it down a few notches. Really I was just here. Just pass by to see how you was doing. I wanted to give you a little something.

When Chris was away things were a whole lot easier. But now that he's back, I don't know.

I just betrayed my husband only to be betrayed by the person I thought I could trust. (knocking on door) Okay. Hello. - [Detective Campbell] Good morning, ma'am. My name is detective Campbell. I was wondering if you have a moment for us to speak. - Speak with you about what? - We're currently investigating a robbery that took place a couple nights ago. - Do I have something to do with that? - [Detective Campbell] No, not exactly. But you were seen with someone who may be involved. May I come in? - Sure. - You were seen at the club, Flows. And there was someone sitting at the bar with you. - Okay? - His name is Quentin Rogers, but you may know him as the name Black. What exactly were the two of you discussing? - That's your question? What we were discussing? - Mr. Rogers has a um, history of finding the most beautiful women and using his charm against their vulnerability. It is not long before he has these women doing anything that he says. Look. I'm just trying to figure out if maybe he mentioned anything about something he's tied into. Or maybe he tried to coerce into anything. - Cops. Everybody's guilty, right? Hmm? But if you must know, no, he invited me out for drinks. And what he was discussing is taking me out on another date. Yeah. - Have you dealt with Mr. Rogers in any other capacity? - [Lena] No, I have not. - Hi buddy. What's your name? - Miles. - I love that name. What are you up to? - Come here, baby. Come here. I need you to go up to your room and finish playing with your toys, okay? I'll be up there in a second. Go ahead. - I love kids. - Yeah. - You have a beautiful son. - Thank you. - Listen. If anything comes up, would you just give me a call? - You know what? I'm fine. Actually. I'm a big girl and I can handle myself. - I'm not saying that you can't take care of yourself, Lena. But I'm trying to warn you that this guy is really dangerous. So be careful. ♪ Welcome to the future - I just wanted you to know that everything we set out to do it's already in motion. Chris, no longer a problem. And I hate it had to be that way, but what was I supposed to do? I knew Chris was gonna come home. Jump right back in the streets with Heavy. I knew Chris was gonna take over Heavy's operation next. I knew that. I knew it was only a matter of time before Heavy got Chris to try to take me out. I couldn't let that happen. Truth be told better his life than mine. Look little bro. I love you. And I ain't gonna forget what they did to you. I ain't having no mercy on nobody. Now I'm gonna take over the North and South side.

What he want? - Hey boss, I got somebody for you to meet. - So you just think it's okay to bring anybody into my establishment, man? - Nah, this my boy, RJ. He trying to join the family. And he said he got some information for you. - Where you from RJ? - From the South side. - South side? So what do you do, man? I ain't never heard of you. You a hustler? Dope boy? You rob? - Well, I do a little something. And I was hoping you can put me on. And I think I got some information that might be valuable to you. - Man, we don't need new people in here dropping off gifts. - Look guys no disrespect, but the streets they talking. Black, he running stuff on the South side right now. Word on the block, Black took his main man, Chris out. And I know Chris from the North. - Yeah, I know Chris very well. Black, too. Chris would've been hit me if something was going down. What's your angle, man? - Yeah, where you getting your information? - I'm just telling you what I know. - So you expect me to believe you bring your black ass in here and give free information? - I was hoping you have a spot for me.

I was talking to your sisters this morning and they said they hadn't heard from you. - I've been busy. - Too busy for your family? Come on, Lena. Stop making excuses for yourself. - I'm not making excuses, first of all. And I'm, I don't know. I just feel like a lot in life I've disconnected from. - Well, it sure hasn't stopped you from bringing my grandson over here every other day. And you need to make sure that that baby is spending time with you. He needs his mom. - Oh so now you give parenting advice? - I beg your pardon? - I'm just saying I've watched you ma. You tend to everybody else but yourself. - That's what a mother does. - So the bruises go a long with it too, huh? You know, growing up I watched you and daddy. And you know what I said? I would never allow a man to make me feel the way daddy made you feel, weak. - So that's what we're doing today? That's what we're doing today? So you're miserable and you think you're gonna come up here in my house and make me miserable too? That's not gonna happen. Listen, baby. I had you and your sisters to think about. And I know that your father, God knows he was not the best, but I stand behind every decision that I made back then. And now. - Yeah. Did you ever once think what you were teaching us though? - What I was teaching you? - Yes. - If anything, I taught you and your sisters how to be strong and how to fight for your family. - No. No ma. - I that's what I taught you. - No. What you taught us, you taught us how to pretend. That's what you taught us. You know what? Look, I matter of fact, you right I'm not doing this today. I'ma get outta here. I need you to watch Miles for me for a couple days. - My grandson is always welcome. - Good. I need to go to the shop. - Lena, Lena. - What? - Listen, your father's not the man he used to be. He is not. And I, I know that he hurt you. He hurt a lot of other members of his family. But baby, he is a changed man. He really is. And before you start looking at everybody else's mistakes and, and judging everybody else. Maybe you need to take a closer look at yourself. Why don't you do that? - Bye mom. ♪ Wait, stop it.

I got money. - Oh man. It ain't about the money. It ain't about the money. It's how you be moving around here man. - I understand. - Listen, man. I don't know. But since I love your little brother, like he was a brother of me. That's the only reason I'm doing this for you. - I respect that. - And you got this detective chick running around here asking questions about you. - Nah. You don't even gotta worry about that. - Like don't don't be bringing him around here deuces up my shit. - Nah. Nah. - Alright. Hey Matt. Get Black whatever he need. - Hey yo Chief, I know you don't wanna hear it. - Yo man. - I highly appreciate this. Now you going outta your way for me. Thank you for real. Wouldn't be possible without you, all right? - Yeah all right. Stupid. Dummy. (door creaks open) - [Lena] Terry, you got some nerve bringing your ass up in here. - I've been calling and texting you with no response. - And you wasn't going to get one. I suggest you pack up all your little shit and take your little trifling ass out of here. - Really? - How long you been sleeping with Black? - I'm not sleeping with Black Lena. - Bullshit! - Lena, I work for Black. Okay? I work for Black, Lena. The other night when I was over by his place, I was just getting ready for a high end client. That's it? Nothing happened. - Take that too. - Lena, sit down. It's time for you to know the truth. - No, I'm not sitting down. What the fuck do you have to say? - All right. Remember the other night when you had us over for dinner and I mentioned my ex-boyfriend to you? What I didn't tell you is that Black and my ex, they know each other. They used to do business together. And I was part of that merchandise. Lena I've been prostituting since I was 16. - You've been doing what? - Yeah. And I can't tell you how many men I've been with or what they made me do. - So is that why you keep running outta here all early every day? - No, that's not all. I was accepted into a nursing school program a while back. I'm two semesters away from finishing. - Why you never told me this till now? - I didn't tell you because for the first time in my life I can see the finish line, you know? I just didn't wanna speak too soon. Okay. I get it. Lena, Black ain't a good person. He uses every woman to get what he wants the same way he used you to get rid of Chris. A few years ago, Black's little brother Twan was killed doing a night drop for Heavy. Black blames Heavy for getting his little brother killed. This ain't the life for me no more. I moved here from Mexico to be here with abuelita. She's dead. There ain't nothing else here for me no more. So I'm transferring schools. - Terry. Listen. I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I treated you like that. I'm I'm sorry I wasn't here for you. - I know your heart chica, but take it from me. Get out this life. It ain't worth it. Okay? I gotta go. - Terry. You are always welcome here. Always. - Thank you. (Machine whirring) - Black! - Just the person I wanted to see. What'd you find out? - Man, I found out everything. - Everything? That's what I'm talking about? Who the connect? - Some white boy. He go by the name Stevenson. Say he outta Orange County. - Stevenson? - Yeah. - Orange county? I don't know. That don't sound too familiar to me. You got his info? - Yeah. - Let me check this out. Hm. It look legit. - Yeah. - So how many dudes Heavy got running with him? - I mean he running with three, so we should be good. - Three? - Yeah. I think we're good. - That ain't too many. All right. So here's the next part of this I need you to get 'em all here. Cause at this point they trust you. - Get 'em here how? - Figure it out! Cause when you do, I'm gonna lay 'em all out one by one. - Wait, wait. So you going to kill them? - You asking a lot of questions and I don't like that. - Black. I just don't remember that being part of the plan. You got the connect. Ain't that enough? - It's never enough. RJ. It's bigger than that. You look nervous. - I'm good. - Got a reason to be nervous? - I'm good man. - Look RJ. RJ don't make me shoot you in your face and throw your ass in the trunk of one of these cars. Look you either with me or you're in my way. What it's gonna be? - I'm with you Black. I'm with you. - You with me? - Yeah, I got you. - Don't be another person in the way. Ain't no bullets in it. Look at you. You a little sweaty man. Fix your shirt. Fix your chain. Oh you shining. You getting too much money. Hey RJ. You doing a good job. I catch you later my man. He gonna get his ass smoked. Hear that OG? But yeah, like I was saying. (door creaks open) - We're closed, come back tomorrow. - Lee Lee. So this is famous Lena's hair salon? This is nice. This where all the money coming in? Oh man. Yeah. I like this. - What are you doing here? - You know what I'm doing here. How your mom's doing? - No, I don't know what you're doing here. - Well, Chris came home. He was supposed to run all this for me. Maybe I get a salon too and get that money. What you do with the money? - What, what money? Chris got all that money. - That's a lie. Word on the street is you giving money out to Black. You're funding his operation. - There is no me and Black. What are you talking about? - You know the worst thing I hate about a person? Becoming a liar. (cocks gun) - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Let me tell you something. - Okay. Please don't hurt me. - You got 24 hours for a hundred grand. If I don't get my money bitch, you'll never see your son again. (Lena crying) You understand what I'm saying to you? - I got it. I will have your money. I'll have it. (door creaks open and closes) (sobbing) Oh my god. - What's good homie? - Shit, what you got left on that thing, man? - I got like an (indistinct) left, really. - Okay. Okay. - I gotta (indistinct) for the whole thing. - Oh, so you need another 18 for that 36? - Yeah, soon as I get straight I got you. - Okay. Yo who that right there? - All right man. So what you got? What you got on that thing, man? I gotta go see Heavy yo. - I got five right here. - Oh five? Oh, lemme get that. Oh let's see what's up with this dude right here, man. Watch out. Watch out. Let me see what's up with this dude. - What's good homie? (gun fires) (tires squeel off) - What's going on mama? - Hey dad. - Hey little man. You getting big. And you shining. Okay. I see your work. - Go play Marcus. - Okay. - I'll talk to you in a few. - Okay. - That's my little man's growing up fast. I got something for you, mama. - Now what is this? - It's money. I give you some every week. - Yes. Yes you do. And I never once questioned you. But I should have asked you a long time ago where is this money coming from? You look at me, Black. The streets are talking and I don't like what I'm hearing about my son. The murders. Is that you doing that? - Ma, I told you don't be listening to that. - Tell me the truth, Quentin. Is it you? - I told you. How long Twan been gone Ma? - Mh-mm. - How long? - Don't you do that. Don't you put your brother's name into this. - My brother is the reason I am the way I am. When they took him, he took a piece of me with him. I don't give a fuck how they feel. - (slapping sound) Don't you raise your voice at me. - I'm sorry, mama. - You're going about this the wrong way. Do you really think your brother would want you doing this? Do you? I'm warning you Black. The knife cuts both ways. And if you don't stop, you're going to get yourself hurt. I've already lost one son. And what about him? He needs you to be his father. Quentin, do the right thing. - I had been calling Black over and over knowing I needed to get this money to Heavy. I must admit I was shocked when he actually showed up. I just don't know what to say Black. - Oh, you don't? You don't gotta say much. It's a hundred grand in that bag. It's enough for you to pay Heavy back and more. (unzips bag) - What about you? - What about me? I got a big drop tonight. It's too hot down here for me to even stay. Even if I wanted to. So I'm gonna go grab my son and I'm outta here by tomorrow morning. I'm heading Upstate. - Your son? You got a son? - Yeah, my son. - Take care of yourself, Black. - Definitely. - They the new Bonnie and Clyde, huh? - Man it's only been 24 hours. She out here moving with this. - I'm telling you, she's in on it. I'ma handle this. - Nah, I got this one. (car pulls up) (somber music plays) (police sirens and indistinct radio chatter) - Oh, I was just texting you. - Oh yeah? It's all there? - I got your money. - Yeah just the way I like it. - Yeah. It's all there. - Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. You know it was never just about the money, right? You know money's important, but you know the one thing I never liked that you be doing? - Yeah? - Showin no damn respect. (gun fires and Lena screams) - In the end we both paid a price. (indistinct radio chatter) Black was sentenced to 10 years for trafficking. But me? I paid the ultimate price. (car horns honking) - Hey, welcome back. - Hey. - Are you dining alone again tonight? - Nope. Not tonight. - Okay. Look at you. I'll be back in a few minutes then. - All right. Thank you. It took you long enough. - We did it. - (laughing) I know. - Oh man. You're so amazing. (music begins) ♪ They didn't believe in me.
