My name's Emilio and l've been at this school since l was 5. l'm 18 now, which means that for 13 years l've been in love with the same girl. At the time l wore orthopedics on my legs. Almost four kilos of iron and two crutches. The big kids called me ''Forrest'' and the others, ''Scrap Metal''. l waited 6 years for the iron to come off and to tell Natalia l love her, but a few days before, my mum took me to the dentist. After that, l was ''Wire Boy''. Then l started getting nosebleeds whenever l got nervous. They wasn't serious and... they were easily fixed. l thought l was done with orthopedics until Merino... threw a medicine ball at me. l wore a neck brace, traction and a back support for two more years. Then l became simply... ''Robocop''. 13 years waiting to become a normal person so l could declare my love. Though probably... neither l nor my friends... would ever be normal people. Coming through. Coming through. -Emilio! -Come here, Flash. Go on, tell me what l got. l need a 7.6 average to get into Medicine. -Take a look! -Alright. José Manuel Sánchez Expósito, better known as ''Flash''. His loss of vision from a congenital disease never stopped him from believing he was a normal kid. -What was it? -A penalty. l'll shoot, l'll shoot. So normal that he even got flash over the dumbest things. Hence the tag, ''Flash''. He's always had one goal in life: to fit in. -l'm in the centre. -Yes. And for Flash, fitting in meant acting like the sighted. There's an aroma here stronger than Vicks Vaporub. lt's cleared up all my pipes. ''Wheels''... He isn't what you'd call a normal person either. His goals in life are personal defense and sex. Don't always do this! Don't believe them! -Get outta here, sucker. -You idiot! But scoring on the dancefloor had always eluded him, so... he developed his own method: listen, understand and console. Let it all out and you'll feel better. Relax. -Flash! -Hey, Goat! Why the long faces? There's still September. l got the goods, and at half price. We steal by night, sell by day: Maths, Latin, Geography... ''The Goat'' isn't exactly normal either. But he's a good guy. Or as good as you can be living the slum life and inheriting the family business. 1 for a euro, 2 for 2 euros! Everyone's a winner, a football or a ham! What do we have here? A microwave for the man! The box comes free! Here! l want a gram. Can you fix me up? l told you, l'm not selling to you. Your head can't take any more drugs. What do you guys want? -Three pink panthers. -And two bickies. See? They take drugs, but they enjoy them. That's 50. This is for your girlfriend. Okay, lady, how are you doing? And the man wins! Ham or a lucky dip? -Quintana, Ramos, Rodriguez... -No, no. -Sánchez Expósito. -That's it. 1.26. What a bummer. l didn't get into Medicine. Bastards. How can you be a doctor, you dick? They've got it in for me. Why can't he be a doctor? Because he can't see? Corneto's our intellectual leader. And he would've been a great one, if he had an intellect. Do pussies have lamps on 'em? You ever seen a gynecologist stick his head in to look? No, man, you don't look, you feel the pussy. lt's true. And l've got highly-developed fingertips. Sure, Flash. And what's more... What do psychiatrists do? Listen. No looking, just listening! And a radiologist? An anesthetist? A chiropodist? My friends and l knew this was the day we'd been waiting for since we were 5. l'd just had my wristbands for tendonitis taken off. For the first time in my life l felt free. Natalia. Emilio, no more wristbands. -Yeah. -He's going for it. l can play basketball and do weightlifting. l couldn't do this before. l mean, rotate it.. for ping pong and table soccer. Congratulations, Natalia. You got the scholarship. Next year... your friend is studying Medicine at the prestigious Oxford University. That's great. Your nose, Emilio. Your nose. BRAlN DRAlN Look, Emilio, did he say Antarctica? No, he said Oxford. lt's right next door. -Aren't you going to do anything? -Yes. l got a job in Carrefour, stacking shelves. You do what you want. lt's all over. -But we'll still see each other? -Sure. We'll nod in the street, ashamed to look at each other because our jobs suck and we let our best friend's girl go. -But relax, everything's fine. -Don't say that again, okay? What don't you want me to say? You let the love of your life go without hearing her say no? You'll be a mess in two months? You don't want me to say that? This makes lovebird calls. lt'll be a scream. Green! Flash! Are you crazy? Don't you know when to stop? Look out! Car! -Stop pissing around, Wheels. -Losers. Look, Emilio, l'll tell you one thing. l'm not deserting a guy who went with me to my mum's chemo. Me neither. He taught me how to kick a penalty using sound. He taught me how to dance to reggaeton, what the fuck. Like it or not, we're going to Oxford to get you your girl. You like the idea? And to study Medicine. They're very advanced there. To Oxford? With all our marks added together, they might even let us pour the dean's coffee. -That's true. -Hey, man... Robbing the Bank of England is hard, but can get into Oxford with my eyes closed. PASSED An 8.9 average, to be sure. Now the scholarships. Make your mark. Perfect. Now the recommendations. The Ambassador, the Minister of the Exterior, the King,... -...and Richard. -What Richard? Richard, with the limp, the street-sweeper. Marichalar. He's cool. lt needs someone foreign, right? Check it out. Ernest of Hanover. Looks like a serious dude. Everyone quiet. Done. You have to be an example of how to fit in, there in Oxford. Look at your dad, eh? Never used a cane in his life. No one has to give us anything. Your mum and l never even got a seeing-eye dog. We picked up a stray and trained it. -Canelo! -Yeah... Canelo! -lch liebe dich. -Dad, he doesn't understand. All his life flat on his back, now he's off to Oxford! Maybe he's got abilities... Mum, we forgot to change the piss bag. lt's almost full. -Let your dad change it. -Keep that crap away from me. l told you not to zap your dad, he's got hypertension. This Oxford thing is weird, son. You don't have to prove anything. Find yourself a girl fast, and if you have to leave her, just get another, not like l did. By the time l left your mum l was bald and there was no way... -You know what l mean? -Yeah, yeah. These losers say they're going to Oxford. -What'll they get up to there? -That's what l said. -Me too. -Hey, nephew. -What? -Are you gettin' any? Everyone here thinks the main thing in this world is love, family... Something they don't mention is right there. Rumpy-pumpy, rumpy-pumpy. l know Medicine's not my thing. But it's one year, Grandad. l'll just try it out, and improve my English. Medicine's the least of it, right? Hide the salami, wet your wang, feed the badger, whatever you call it. lf l regret anything, it's not fucking when l was 20 what l can't fuck at 50. You lose your drive. This is dead weight now. Here, l got you some Tupperware. l did everything to win your grandma. l was after her all day. She was a free spirit, a wonderful loony. And look, here l am, just like the first day. Where's your grandma? She's over there. You're going to kill yourself! Get down! Can't you see you could fall and hurt yourself? Are you mad? -Are there girls or not? -Yes, there are. -On... on your left. -Left... Girls... Don't leave me here! Okay, kid... ''When American boys get the urge they stick it in an apple pie, but there's nothing like hot French toast, nephew. l made it with icing sugar so it doesn't scrape your dick. Big kiss, Uncle Julián.'' Guys! Did you know a Nobel Prize winner teaches 3rd year? lt's top notch here. Jesus, we're stuck in a Mass. You want to bet how long we last? l say under two hours. So who's that? The Dean? Understand? Fuck you, Harry Potter! Talk properly or l'll smash you! Stop it, Goat. Shut up. Please. What's he saying? Look. lt's Natalia. You see that fucker? She just got here and he's sniffin' around. Emilio, where are you going? Emilio, cheer up. lt's okay. All you have to is impress her. You don't have to be well-read, just appear to be. -Do l use magic? -No, not magic. What you do is... Look, cram this into you. Just a few chapters, to show off. Listen to me, these girls fall in love with a brain. Check him out again. Look at that sucker go for it. With a violin, the whole shit. That predator's not swiping my friend's girl. Listen, man. He's just talking to her. -He looks like a nice guy. -Goat... Come with me and play along. Spanglish? You parle Spanglish? Yes. l did my Erasmus year in Spain. lt's not my first degree. l'm in 4th year Chemistry too. You got balls. How's it going? lt's hectic, actually. l'm a bit on edge. l'm on the rowing team, l play the violin... lt's all piling up. l had exactly the same trouble... until a friend gave me some herbs. Some capsules, homeopathy, Valerian root. Ever since then, it's been a fucking breeze. Goat, let him try. Hey, to take this stuff you need your head together. He said he's got two degrees! His head's no problem. Right... One, two... Breakfast, lunch and dinner. lt'll do you good. Thanks. What did we give him? 50% MDMA, 50% heroin. He'll study his ass off. Damn, check out that chick. ''Claudia Smith and her theatre group are seeking actors for Romeo and Juliet.'' Good. We just got to Oxford, and the hottest girl here gives us her phone number. l don't know about hot. She's the type that puts her panty liners on with staples. This is going to be tough. Every twenty seconds l need the dictionary. l got it worse, l gotta learn English as l go. Hey, guys! What's with the glasses, Flash? With my lazy eye l can spot a few letters. Did you see this? They want sperm donors for the Assisted Reproduction Lab. He's going to give 'em a shower. We'll make a killing. They pay by weight, don't they? By weight? Are going to take them a25litre keg? 25, no. But 5, yeah. By the end of the year, a good jug, for sure. What are you gonna fill, softcock? Not a canteen, not even a yoghurt tub, moron. Oh, no? What do you bet? Go on, 100 pounds. -100 pounds? -Yes. l'll fill it by the end of the year. lt's no match for Braille. -Check him out. -What's up, Chamberlain? -How's it going? -Good. l'm much more relaxed. Carbajosa? Emilio Carbajosa! What are you doing here? l mean, what a surprise. l didn't know... -Are you studying Medicine? -Yes. As you see. l had so many problems as a kid, l want to help other kids. Every school has its Forrest Gump, doesn't it? That's beautiful. ln the end, it's the people who've had a hard time that move the world. -l'm so excited! -Me too! Our school had some high fliers. High,... very high. Well, there are others from our school in this class. There. -My bag. l'll be right back. -Okay. -See you! -What did she say to you? She says... l move the world. l move the world, damn it. Get lost, fuckerito. l'm glad you're here. -Go on! Have some balls! -Get your grades up! -Tell him! -Go for it. Me! l know! Van Brostock, 17th century. Thanks. -We'll have to meet up to study. -Yes, of course. That would be best. -Come to my room tonight. -Done. Okay. Ciao. His dick's halfway in. -Did you hear that? -What? That voice. On the P.A. She's got something special. She's got what they've all got. A double Whopper, pretty pink and very rare. You're so gross, Wheels. How about a little sensitivity? l'm going after that girl. You'll see. Fuck. That guy's wheelchair is cool. -Here, some sandwiches. -Cool. Really, guys, l can't. l can't. l should've asked her to go to a museum, to the theatre, but studying in her room...? lt's a trap, it is. What you mean, a trap? Look... Do you fuck in a theatre? -No. -No. -Do you fuck in a museum? -No. Do you fuck in dorm rooms? -No. -Yes, you do. lf you don't fuck in theatres and museums, but you do in dorm rooms...? Why do you think she invited you to her room? -To fuck! -l don't want to fuck just yet! Okay? A little time with her is enough for me. Why not take her a lung? To study, l mean. lnstead of a photo in a book, it's the organ in person. And you can touch it! Let's go, let's go. Careful! The dead, oh no, the dead! Check out the axe wound on Mrs. Winslow here. A little respect, okay? Drunkchicks.com doesn't have this much tit and ass! Flash, Flash! Check out these tits! Let me feel. Leave the dead alone! They can curse you! That's enough, guys. Let's get the lung and go. -There it is. Up there. -There it is. l'll go up. -Make it quick, Emilio. -Okay. Up we go. -There it is. Okay, okay. -You're not alone, Emilio. -We're right here. -Quit pushing! We're surrounded by stiffs! -What are you doing? -lt's meant to look like we fucked. -Come on, you've got it. -Careful! Careful! Look out, Emilio. Hold on! You've got it. l've got it! What's this? That's disgusting. Let's go, guys. l've got to get changed. Let's get outta here. Keep it away from your face! Come on, Goat. -Oh, man, l left the card outside! -What do you mean? -We're locked in! -You must have it, Goat! -Try another one. -No, Flash, it says here: Morgue. Check your pocket! Please! -We're locked inside! -Please! Open the door! Get up! -What is it? -Emilio's not here! -He's disappeared! -Disappeared? Emilio! Emilio! Emilio! -He's not here! -Emilio! Where's he gone? Shit, the pendant. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. Where the hell is it? Jesus, look at this. Look at this... Jesus Christ! Hello, Natalia. These are for you. Emilio, what do you want? Nothing's the way it seems. l'm not a necrophile and l'm not here to study Medicine. l came to tell you... l've been in love with you since l was 5. l thought you'd never get up the nerve. We've wasted too much time. What are you saying? What? lf l take her flowers, she'll forget l'm a necrophile? And even sleep with me? Besides, to do that... l need more confidence. -You know that, guys. -Open the blinds. l'll get them. lf you don't like that plan, l've got more. No more plans for me. -No more plans? -Yes. ''No more plans''? The Trojan Horse. The Normandy Landing. Do you think back then some dickhead said, -''No more plans!''? -Yes. -No! -Historically, that never happened. Why? Because it'd mean giving up. Hello. Excuse me. l've run out of Valerian and... l'm rather wound up. Where can l buy them? They don't sell these, man. No ''selling''. But... Wait, l'll see what l can do. We're gettin' the kid in trouble. Nobody sticks their finger up my friend's ass. -Don't give him all of them, okay? -No. Chamber! -Thanks. -Don't abuse them, eh? What is this plan exactly? Saving her life. Wouldn't you see someone who saved your life differently? lf you look at it like that. So l... follow her until she's in danger, then save her? We'll set it up. -We'll create the danger. -Right, what do we need? -A psychopath? A rapist? -Listen, l think a mugging will do. Mrs. Wellington... No, that's not Wellington. Mr. Williams. Mr. Brown. Are you looking at me? -Are you looking at me? -What's he doing? -l don't know. -Don't you look at me. Fuck, don't look at me! l'll give you one! Don't you look at me! l'll give you one! Let's get out of here. Oh, fuck... Sorry. Sorry. lt's just... -Hold on, hold on! -lt's fine. Look, it's no big deal. He's reconciling with the corpse. lt's okay, it's okay. l got a bit mad. He's a good guy. We'll sound him out, then make up our minds. Well, Potro, are you on for the job, or not? -ls it with whores? -With whores? Yeah, sure. Any whores you want, eh? But after the job. First some knuckle work. No, no, no! No knuckle work. You just pretend you're going to do it. Just pretend. Do you understand? l understand. Good. Do you understand? l understand. l can't see this working. So... l attack the girl... Then... Emilio turns up and we go at it. You and me, eh? Tell him to stop. No, Potro, no fighting. Emilio... Take this. You hit me with this. -Here, in the back. -No, no. Thanks, but there's no need. lt'll be fine, man. l put on an iron plate. Emilio... See this? -She's coming! -She's leaving the library! Potro. Potro. Get going, damn it! -Take this. -What's this for? Move it. -He's going the wrong way. -Okay, l see. Don't be fussy, it's fine.. He's lost his way a bit, but... Potro! Potro! The girl! Move it. They'll spot us. l can't do it. l'm not taking the stick. No stick? You have to be violent so she believes you. God, God, God. Are you Spanish? Yes. -You too? -Yes. What a coincidence. So, what are you doing here? l... l was a boxer. But a bop on the bean made my brains all mushy. What? Too shit-scared to defend your girl? Not even in a set-up? Have some balls. Are you going to relive the past 13 years? You don't do anything unless we do it for you. Loser! You know what you are? A corpse-fucker. You are. -No! -Yeah, a corpse-fucker. Go and hit that iron plate! -What's going on, Emilio? -He's fondling her. He's feeling her up. -Go, go! -Go! Thanks for listening. Truth is, l'm lonely here, far from home... You fucking bastard! -What is it? -He smashed him in the head. Emilio? Buddy? That was the iron plate. The iron plate... And for Spanish students like me, l remind you that today we celebrate Constitution Day. ''Dear Angelic Voice. l wanted to thank you personally... for reminding me about the discussion group at 4. So goodbye now, and here's my email, in case you want to remind me of something... personally. To... the Angelic... Voice.'' You got an 8.5 in Pharmacology! lt's a B-plus, man. l haven't been to class for a month. Dickhead, we did a switch. What's with the chair? Give it back. Give it back! No, not that. Let's calm down. Okay? Suck my tool. Yes, you give the chair back. And you, calm down and wake up. We've got a terrific idea. Alright, Emilio... To Natalia right now, you're a weirdo. For two reasons: you're a necrophile and violent. Girl's don't like that much. So you clean up your image. And how? Get a girlfriend. One that's real tasty. That's it. A girl can ignore you all her life, but if she sees you with another chick, things change. lt's true, Emilio. She starts thinking you must have something. What's he up to? Wheels, please! Get her up to the room! We can't be seen with her! She can't be my girlfriend! Look how she's dressed! How is she dressed? How? Damn it, you stole the Professor's clothes bag. -There's all kinds of stuff here. -Maybe this... Sure, put some tennis gear on her. And you put on a tracksuit. Two healthy tennis players, that's what you need. No, what l need is to be born again. Emilio, don't even joke about that. That's right, less drama, be more positive. What you have to do is to give her lots of tongue. -That'll get Natalia jealous. -That's it. -Get that tracksuit on. -Let's go. -Has he gone? -Yes, he's gone. Guys... What's up? -Shit, Flash. -Sorry. Man, her dong's bigger than mine. Holy Christ! Virgin of the Gypsies! -What the hell did you bring here? -She's got a pretty face. -A pretty face? -My God. My God. -We have to tell Emilio. -Let's not be drama queens. She's got a pecker, so what? ls she going to show it? No. We keep our mouths shut. Emilio's very fussy... -How do l look? -Great. Great, man... l mean, lady. What? Did you see the girl? Yes? We have to do something. -Shall we go at it? -Let's wait. lf you don't mind. She saw me. She saw me, Daisy. -God, again. -Take it easy. -ls this going to work? -Of course it will, honey. She looks gorgeous. Run your hand over my shoulder, like we're going out. l like it when you get into it. Wonderful. Let me go, let me go. -What's wrong? -Just a tender hug. lt's not about that. Fuck... l made myself dizzy this time. Flash, you bastard. Flash, you bastard. Wheels. See who it is. ''Dear Flash, l'll wait for you tomorrow at Oxford Blues. l'll be at a table 17. Signed: Angelic Voice.'' That's great, man. The P.A. chick's into it. What answer do l put? No answer. -What? -No. You're not backing out now she's in the bag? Yes, l am. What do you think'll happen when she sees that l'm blind? To girls, this is a defect, and you know it. Forget it. Come on, man. You're a great guy. You're good-looking. Your defect is nothing. You barely notice it. Not like me, you can see me coming in my chair. You too! Do you have to tell the whole truth on a first date? ''Look, dinner was nice, but l just want to shag you''. No, people keep their trap shut, and so will we. -What do l do? -You have to get into it. Give me a kiss. lt's working, it's working. She's coming over. Corneto was right, l know nothing about girls. l don't know a thing. Get up, get up! Please! She's coming! What? You look stunning. Hello. Sorry for interrupting. -What are you doing here? -Hello. That's okay, l'm with my girl. Daisy. Natalia, Daisy. Daisy, Natalia. l was looking, but l wasn't sure it was you. Of course, honey. -You know each other? -Sure. From a pilot program with the Faculty. How are the hormones going? l'm so happy. Excuse me, babe. Take a look. l said bye-bye to that hair. And l've got an appointment for the sex-change. That's great. l'm so glad. l'm a bit worried about the vaginaplasty. They told me they're turning my gland into a clitoris. l kind of make myself sick, and l just don't want to know, but look at me, drop-dead gorgeous. You look fantastic too, honey. Cross my legs. l'll look more elegant. l need Velcro. My leg slips and l look like Carol Burnett. Goat, the other leg! Look out! l'm slipping! Take it easy, it's a rehearsal! -We're getting better at this! -20, 21, 22... -What's up, Walter? -...26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31... ...32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37... Here's the bar! l'm the shit! Now it's just like home. -Emilio! How are you, man? -Emilio! -l'm fine. -Look at his face. He's in love. ''From the creators of the Theft of the Lung,...'' Yeah. ''...and the director of The Punchy Boxer, coming to you now... The Tranny Tennis Player. A Story of Love and Balls. We should've told him. -Shut up, Flash. -You knew, didn't you? -Yes. -No. -Did we know? -Yes. Just a wild guess, nothing we could... put our finger on. lt's fine. lt's fine. Necrophile, violent, now l'm seeing a tranny tennis player on hormones. -Do you know l'm called now? -No. The Golden Bachelor. Oxford's Mr. Popularity. Hannibal Lecter... is a regular guy compared to me. Let's face it, this is all wrong. Genital apparatus, forget it! The turkey, the burger, the poontang, the muff, with its various parts: the bush, the jelly bean, Miss Wrinkly, exterior and interior, making this, in short, the twat! Very well, we shall continue tomorrow. Emilio. Emilio. Well... l was thinking and... Maybe you won't feel like it, but l'll say it just in case. Would you like to have dinner with me tonight? Yes, damn it. Okay. Okay. 9.30 at Oxford Blues. lt's on Wellington St. -Sorry, l couldn't find a taxi. -Never mind. -Shall we go inside? -Okay. -My family's already seated. -Your family? What do you mean ''your family''? -Take a seat, Emilio. -Sit here. Hi, honey. -Hello. -Do you like foie gras? Foie gras... Sure, l love it. Really? Help yourself. 11, 12, 13,... Come on, champ. 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. The lamp... Walter... Here. Where's that angelical voice? -Flash? -Yes. l'm here. Anyway, William, it's only a cold. Give me a hug, man. Come on, cheer up. -Hi. -Hi. Hello. -l'm Claudia. -How are you? Fine. Excuse me if l don't get up. l pulled a muscle jogging... -and it's still on the mend. -Don't worry. So you're a director, an actor... More director than actor. Cool, that's great. A toast! -Cheers! -Cheers! -We're going to the bathroom. -Very well. Let's get to it. The night's slipping by. Right, son... May l call you 'son'? Yes, of course. When did you start penetrating corpses? You know this place, so... you order, l don't mind. l like everything. Me? Order? -Yes. -Yes. Sure. Well, there are the typical dishes... Potatoes, chicken, tomatoes... salad, fish, cheese selection... and side dishes. l can guarantee everything. Walter, one of these and one of these... Walter? And lots of wine, Spanish wine. The homeland calls... You dropped your keys. No, don't worry, l've got another copy. About ''Romeo and Juliet''... Emilio, what is this? We're here on Operation Cripple! Her dad asked me about my necrophilia. l don't get it. Do you guys know something? Goat, Corneto, please... Personally, l'd add... some touches to the text. You dropped your mobile. Never mind, it's got no credit left. Look, Natalia's philanthropic. She helps people with problems. You've got big problems, and that's what we told her. Cheer up, her family's concerned about you. Sure. You agree to minor charges, like at a trial, and go with it. But her dad asked me when l started fucking corpses! Relax, they're psychiatrists, you can't shock 'em. lt's normal to them. -Your disorder will attract her. -Your trauma. Your trauma. That's the way. Go on, and play your cards right. -My cards? -Sure. Fuck your cards. Fuck them, Corneto. l made a reservation. Shall we talk over dinner? Sure, sure. l'll just go to the bathroom. You ordered very well. lt's all delicious. l'm good at this. Did l tell you you're beautiful? lt's just... Are you okay? What's wrong? Swallow.. bones... Drink some wine. No, eat some bread! lt'll push it down. Flash, where are you going? Flash! ls there a link between your ''philias''? Do you strike the corpses when you defile them? Your disorder will attract her. -Your trauma. That's the way. Do you strike them, son? On occasion. -On occasion. -lt's... -A love-tap. -A love-tap. A paddy-whack on the bottom. A paddy-whack on the bottom. ''Romeo and Juliet, the Musical''. What a great idea. We must put it on. -Sure, sure, sure. -Come on, a toast. Bloody hell... l think he wants to get past. Okay. Look, no! l'm not moving! People like you here... ...with your defect, no. Understand me? Go to places with ''ramping''. Get lost before l smack you. Are you excited by fresh corpses, or when they're putrefied? Fresh. Fresh. Very fresh. You're an insensitive prick. Look, one thing... You needn't be like that. l'm a paraplegic too. Claudia! Go to hell, you bastard! Look, l've got the piss bag, the whole shebang! lt's true! lt's true! lt's true! l can't move my legs! We've got something, honey! We do, damn it! Hello! Flash, where were you? What happened? Didn't you hear it? No. A ruckus in the bathroom. They were picking on a blind guy and l stepped in to sort it out. -How about that? -You're lovely. Well... l didn't have too much faith in blind dates. -A truer word was never said. -Why do you say that? Walter! Walter! Off home are you? What are you wearing? l saw you, you slob! Bloody slob! Why did you say that? Why else? Because l'm blind. The things you say, Flash. Go on... How can you be blind? Right. There was something l was going to say. You've gone all serious, eh? No. l'll make it easy for you. Okay? lf you get up and leave, you've got a perfect right. l understand. No... Truth is, maybe it's like you say, l'm not ready for a relationship with a blind person and... maybe we should stop it now. -Hey, guys, how are we? -What's up? Emilio! How was it? Good, l think. -l had to get lucky sometime. -Good going, tiger! -l'm glad, man. -How about you guys? Well, good... Kind of like you... good... Two more dinners and l'll be fucking her. l'll be fucking her too. Mine, l mean. That's great, eh? Yeah. -Another round to celebrate! -Let's go! Hey, mister! And Gibraltar for the Spanish! So, Granddad, is there any solution for my friend? Look, my girl... This boy doesn't fit any abnormal behavioral pattern or Steinmer's Syndrome. What? He has no pathology, girl. Don't ask me why, but it's all a lie. What seems true, by the way he looked at you over dinner, is that he's in love with you. That's the only thing for sure. And the only diagnosis. Okay? Slow down, Emilio! Stop rushing! Where are you going? Two of us are disabled. To Spain. Oxford, all this shit, it's over. Emilio, it's not so bad. -What's wrong now? -What's wrong? l imagined l'd sit down one day with Natalia's parents and call them my in-laws. They'd ask me what team l supported. -You know what they asked me? -What? lf l came on the corpses l defiled. -What happened? -He pushed him over. Grab a club and finish off the paraplegic, you fuck! lf you're mad, then tell her the truth! The truth? Yes. The truth is, you're blind. And despite your idiotic prancing, you'll still be blind! He's got no fucking idea. You dump a girl you like, and you know why? Because she's blind! ldiot! You're an idiot! No! l pretended l could see. l didn't want her to think l was laughing at her! Bastard. Bastard. Fucking bastard! Calm the fuck down! Emilio... Next time, no motherfucker is coming to help you. Help me, Wheels? You're a freak who's got nothing outside of school, the same as all of us. We're the trash that sticks together. We couldn't choose our friends. -And this is what we got. -That'll do, eh? Let's calm down. We've had a few too many. lt's okay, we'll think of a plan. A plan. Why don't you find a plan for yourself, Corneto? Why don't you stop screwing up my life... and admit that you like guys? lt's easier to screw up my life and fill jugs up with sperm like an asshole, because so far that's all you've done with your dick! Stop! Stop! This is it! Did we have to bring the dog? This is digusting! -How much is it? -Get off! lsn't this beautiful, Canelo? -Get the bags out! -This Arab's no help! 200 euros this guy with the beard says! Fuck that! Get a receipt, we'll put it on our tax. Put away the converter and pay. The man's a Muslim. Watch your change, they steal from you. Really? More, more. Here, and God be with you. Or Buddha, Allah... Let's go. -l got your number plate, lad. -Forget it. Go on. Put on your turban. l'm excited about seeing the boys. You know what my doctor said about my hiatus hernia? He wanted a second opinion. My son's. That's the way. lf l were 30 years younger l'd run myself ragged in Oxford. Babycakes! How long does the song last? 3 minutes and 30 seconds. l only need 3 to say what l want to say. l'm a friend of Flash. Do you know he records your voice over the P.A.? And he listens to it some nights? No, l didn't know. l don't know what you think, but anyone who does that is usually in love. But Flash, my friends and l are really awkward. We make easy things hard and take the long way round. Do you know why? Fear. l do the most absurd things. l forge files, steal lungs, hire transvestites... l'm capable of anything. But my legs shake at the idea of inviting a girl l like to coffee. Because the day l do it and she says no... l won't be in love anymore. l've been like this for 13 years. 13 years making excuses for not telling Natalia l love her. The only girl who ever smiled at me without looking at the iron on me. How much of the song is left? 40 seconds, more or less. Now l realize l only needed a 3 minute 30 song to tell her. Just 3 and a half minutes. And l've got a chorus left over. l've even lost my friends. l don't know what l'll do without them. But you can't lose Flash. lf he takes the long way round, go and find him... because he's the greatest guy in the world. The greatest. Where's Emilio? He's gone to the station. He's going back to Spain. -To Spain? -Yes. At 12.40 he'll be on the train to Hendaya. Natalia, l don't know if it'll be a yes or a no. But give him an answer. He's waited for 13 years. Well, if he wants an answer... l'd better give him one, right? 13 years is a long time. And my girl's coming with me. l want you to know one thing. l got scared yesterday, but l don't care if you're blind. lf you can't see, then l'll be your eyes. l'll be your guide, and we all work it out! Give me one. No! English food is full of cholesterol. Canelo, get off! lch liebe dich. Sit. -Your mutt's eating the sausages! -Sit. ln all these months you must've met some girl. l don't mean a girlfriend... No, Dad. Don't be a drag. l haven't had a girlfriend, a shag, nothing. Shit, stop bugging the kid. l'm going to your room for a shower. Sure, get out of here. Look, look, look. Here good sausageness. Much sausageness. Look, nephew. Check out those thunderthighs. Her veins stick out. Legs built for action. There go the doctors. -l'll get us a ride. -Go on, hurry! Kids! Kids! l can't now, Mum. We have to give Emilio a hand! Come on! Coming! Well done, lad! Couldn't you get something simpler, like a snow plough, or a harvester? lt was the only one with keys in it! lt's perfect. A double-decker bus! We can use the bus lane! Great! Let's go! Who's going to drive? Can you drive, Flash? What the hell are you doing? You idiot, you don't know when to stop! l said l'd drive and l will! Let go of the wheel! -You hear this asshole? -Don't fuck this up for me. When the time comes to tell her, l will. But let me do this, please! Goat, help me. Go on. -Come on! -Bloody hell, Flash! Just listen to me. Clutch, then first gear. lt's dead straight, 400 metres. We're doing it, Goat! -l'm driving, man! -Straighten up! Veer left! Look out! We're going to die! Why are they so late? lt's a power failure. No one's coming on till it's fixed. How many paces to the stage? People will cool off and even the Stones couldn't kickstart it. About 10 metres. l'm going up. l think it's 12 metres. No, it's 10. Where's he going? To the stage. Now right, Canelo, right. Son, what's this? ls this semen? Be careful! Be careful! We'll kill ourselves! l've got it under control. Take it easy, honey! Everything's fine! Dis big poof, dis little gay... he comes and he say... Faderr, Faderr, take me to di circus! My son, if someone wanna see you, let him come our house, di madefucker, son of a...! Don't you realize you're burning yourself out? You drifting here on the high seas. You're not selling your precious bodily fluid? -Don't leave it with kids' food. -What a prude. Did something happen to you here? l don't know what it is, but it can't be that serious. Well... Look, Dad, every weekend you ask me the same thing: Did l get laid? Did l get a girlfriend? And it's always no. l was sending out signals. But only when your best friend tells you you're a poof do you get the balls to be one. That's what happened, Dad. See how it wasn't that serious? Lots of people are gay these days. You bastard! You're a clever one. ln this world, gays get laid more than anyone. Dong, butthole, pussy, as long as you bake the cookies. -Oh, shut up. -Excuse me. Your friend in the wheelchair. ls he disabled? Wheels? His whole life. Do you know where he is? l think so. Damn it, now he's gone poof, he takes girls for a ride. Leave the kid alone. Let's go. What is this? This is a snail's pace! Step on it or we won't make it! Look straight ahead. l feel much safer. Stop! Stop! The scooter! Corneto's here with Wheels' girl! The one with the limp! -Who limps? -Wheels' girl! l had to talk to you. Relax. Let's go in back and talk. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. Shit... Guys, l've got one thing to say. l like the Hershey Highway. Flash, what are you doing? Let someone else drive! Let someone else drive. l got us this far. The road here is terrible. -l'll drive. -Get going. Here l go. The carriage is mine, my Queen. Emilio! l heard your speech. The whole Faculty heard it. The mike was on. l always thought you were the nicest guy in the class. l don't know about nice... But l've got more to offer than it seems. -You're leaving, aren't you? -Yes. l've been offered another job. Technical engineer for spaces, cabinets and refrigerators. Whatever stacking shelves in Carrefour requires. How about you? l might be leaving this summer to go to Harvard. The best oncologists are there. You go to Harvard... and l go to Carrefour. Well then... if you come back to Spain one day and drop by... l'll put aside some expired yogurts for you. That stuff about them going off is an urban legend. See you, Natalia. l'm sorry. l'm really sorry. l swear, l had no idea you were disabled. Take it easy. lt's alright. Let it all out. l couldn't imagine you laughing at your misfortune. You're an example of overcoming adversity, and treating you like that was just terrible. Come here. Come here. Take it easy. lt's alright. Emilio got on the train. He got on the train. He got on. Don't let him get away. Go on, run. Run! l forgot something. That thing over the P.A. was a kind of declaration. Wasn't it? Then l have to give you an answer. lt's the done thing. lf that didn't make it clear... that l like you... though you do have problems... l don't... Corpses give me the creeps. Goat, what happened? -What is it? -Oh, Flash... Shit, tell me! l'm blind! He's giving her a huge kiss, the bastard! A big sloppy one! He's suckin' face bigtime! -Go, Emilio! -Go! Go, Natalia! We're in Oxford now, but they'll be at it till Cambridge. Let's go before Scotland Yard comes after us. And Camila Parker too! lt's all your fault, Canelo.
