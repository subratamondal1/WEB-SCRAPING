Gregory, answer that phone, please. Hello. It's 7:30. Well, what of it? Oh, I did ask you to call me at 7:30. Thank you very much, operator. Gregory? Gregory, wake up. - Did you knock, sir? - Twice. What's the idea, are you going to sleep all day? All day, sir? No, sir. It's only.. - It's only 7:30, Mr. Thomas. - What of it? Well, you never get up before noon, sir. I had no idea you were expecting me this early. That's all changed. Come, we have work to do. I shall have to put on my trousers first, Mr. Thomas. Never mind your pants, man. - Come on. - Bu-bu-bu-bu-but-- Stop talking like a motorboat, and come on. If you'll only allow me to put on my trousers, sir I might be able to prepare your breakfast. I don't want any breakfast, and I don't want your trousers. We've got to hurry. If I might know the reason for all this haste, sir? "Yours not to reason why, yours but to do or die." - Yes, sir. - Gregory. We have to get rid of these photographs. - Photographs. - Don't be an echo, Gregory. - I said photographs. - Yes, sir. She'll never like these, Gregory. - You better throw them all out. - She? She who, sir? Miss Channing. The girl I'm going to marry. You're going to get married, sir? Next month. Congratulate me. Well, if you'll only allow me to put on my trousers, sir I might be able to understand a little better. - Burn them all. - Yes, sir. - Gregory. Call the florist. - Yes? And tell him to send a corsage of orchids. Yes, sir. Uh, would you like me to prepare breakfast first, sir? Haven't any time. She'll be here at 4:30. - 4:30? - Yes. Well, it's only 7:40 now, sir. - Only 7:40? - Yes, sir. We haven't a moment to spare. - Gregory. - Yes, sir? You'll have to burn these too. Burn all these telephone numbers, sir? But they took you years to collect. - I know. Burn them all. - Yes. Who can that be at this hour? Would you like me to answer, sir? Of course. - Oh, Gregory. - Yes, sir? If it's a woman's voice, please say I've, I've left town. Yes. Where to, sir? I've gone to, to China. China. Yes, sir. Uh, Mr. Thomas' residence. Who's speaking, please? No. Mr. Thomas has gone to China, Miss Channing. - No, no, no, you're crazy! - No, no, no, you're crazy. No, no, no, she's not crazy. Marjorie. Marjorie dear, I was just trying to te-tell Gregory to get out the china. Yes, dear. Yes. Yes, you'll be here at 4:30? Well, that's fine, dear. Yes, I'm getting everything prepared for you. Yes, darling. Yes, honey. Yes, dear. Yes. - Gesundheit. - Why, thank you, sir. What's the matter, Gregory, you got a cold? Yes, sir. I think I must have...caught it.. ...this morning, sir. This morning, Gregory? Yes, sir. - Sugar? - Honey. No. No, I meant, do you want sugar in your tea? Oh, two, please, dear. I don't suppose I'm the only girl who's ever been here with you alone before. You're the only girl who's ever meant anything. Marjorie.. This means an awful lot to me. It means more than.. ...everything in the world. I hope it means that much to you. It does, Jack. Every bit as much. Sweetie. That's lovely music, isn't it? Music, is there music? Why, so there is. Oh, your hair is, is.. ...yellower than, than.. What's something good and yellow? Mm, now, let's see, ten-dollar gold pieces. Mm. Your hair is yellower than twenty-dollar gold pieces. When's it going to be, beautiful? When do you want it to be? Next month. That will give us the winter in Europe, the honeymoon. - Alright? - Oh, it's alright with me. But you'll have to see mother and father first. Yes. I suppose they do have to be consulted. Well, who breaks the news to mother? Well, let me do it. Then when you walk in I'll give you sort of an entrance. Say some nice things about me. - Are there nice things to say? - Nothing but. I've got a lot of money. You can consult my guardian on that point. I come from a good family. Although mother and father are dead, as you know. Well, that gives me nothing to worry about but you. What else could they possibly want? Darling, they'll fall on your neck. - How? - Like this. - Hello? - Hello, Jack. This is Papa Mario. Hello, Papa Mario. The guardian I was telling you about. Hello, you big stiff. How are ya? I'm fine. I'm crazy about you. Huh? No. Oh. Uh, what is it? You've got news for me? He's got news for me. Maybe the stock market's gone up. Huh? No. No, I don't want to come to your office now. Well, why don't you try to tell me over the phone? You know, I got one bad habit. I got to be kissed when I'm telephoning. Huh? No, I-I haven't.. I haven't heard a word you've been saying. I'm talking as loud as I can. What's wrong with you? There must be two people on this wire. Alright, alright, I'll be down right away. Say, I have some news for you too. No, I can't tell you my news either. Hey, wait a minute. Listen to this. Did you hear that? "What was it?" It was marvelous. Alright, you old bear. I'll be down there in a little while. And, you.. dine with me tonight at the Biltmore. Mm-hmm. And tell your parents this afternoon. Mm-hmm. And kiss me now. Mm-hmm! - Hello, Papa Mario! - Hello, Jack. - Well, here I am. - 'I'm glad to see you.' I'm glad to see you. What's all the shooting about? Haven't overdrawn my account again, have I? It's more important than that, Jack. There's nothing as important as what I have to tell you. Now, grab your smelling salts. I'm gonna be married. - So? - Yes, so. Next month. Hey, I haven't suddenly become a pauper, have I? No, you have plenty of money. You say the nicest things. Enough so that after our marriage we can have a honeymoon trip abroad? - Yes. - That's settled. Now, give me a nice big check. I've got to go out and hunt up an engagement ring. Jack, you must listen first to what I have to tell you. Oh, some other time. Jack. Well, alright, shoot. What's the bad news? Say.. It isn't really bad news? Well, it should be in a way. It might not be everything considered. It is bad news only it isn't bad news because maybe it is. You know, that's what I like about lawyers they always make everything so clear for you. Jack.. You have a father. You mean, I had a father. At least I hope so. If I, if I hadn't one it might've been, uh.. quite a blow to my mother. I mean, you have a father now. A father, living? He's on his deathbed. But you gave me to understand that both my parents were dead that I was an orphan. 'It was better that way.' Well.. Where is my...my father? In Jersey City. My father, dying. No, I don't get this. The old thinking apparatus is working in low. Uh.. What's my, my father dying of? He was shot. Shot? While, uh.. While hunting? No. While being hunted. Suppose you tell me everything. It would be a better plan if your father himself told you. He wants to see you before he dies. This is the address. Go there at once. When you get there, ask for your brother Frank. I have a brother too? Frank Tomasulo. He is a few years older than you. - Frank what? - Tomasulo. Your name is Giacomo Tomasulo. 'You're Italian.' Why wasn't I told all this before? It wasn't necessary until now. Oh, this is completely insane. It's nutty. It doesn't make sense. I'm an orphan, only I have a father who's dying. I'm all alone in the world, only I have an older brother. My name is Jack Thomas, only it happens to be Gia-Gia-- - Giacomo. - G-Giacomo. No, I don't believe all this. Now, stop joking. No, Jack, it's not a joke. Hey, listen. I'm gonna be married to a girl who means more to me than anything on earth. Now, there's nothing going to break that up. No father, no brother, no-- No, no, of course, not. When she learns the truth, she will probably understand. I don't care whether she understands or not. And what do you mean by "When she learns the truth?" Is there more to this than what you've told me? There is more. You'll find out all from your father. What's on your mind? I want to see Frank Tomasulo. What'll I tell him? His brother. Giacomo. Hey, Mabel. - What? - Watch the desk. Alright. Swell night, eh? Yes. Do you come from the undertaker? No, I don't. Well, the old man's picklin' in. I thought maybe you were from the undertaker on account of your dark clothes, and looking so clean. Alright, Mike, shoot. There's a guy outside, Frank. Wants to see ya. He says he's your brother. Yeah? Send him in. Alright, send him in. - He don't look like you. - Go on. That's for you. Thank you. So, you're Giacomo. Shut the door. Sit down. The old man's pretty bad. Can't last more than a day or two. Wants to see ya. Have a drink. Well, here's to family life. That stuff ain't cut, it's what we use ourselves. He's upstairs. One of Florio's men got him through the chest. It's alright though. We took care of that guy a couple of days ago. Say, how much did Mario tell you? Nothing, except that you were my brother and that my, uh.. my father was dying. Did he tell you what our racket was? Ah! Well, then I'll tell ya. We run a string of booze trucks from Montreal to here. Oh, it's a good racket. Plenty of sugar in it. Only you gotta take your chances. The old man took his. That's why he's got a slug in his chest. Say, you coulda knocked me over with a half pint of White Rock when pa told me that I had a brother who was a...a gentleman. Say, you don't do no work. How do ya pass the time? - I manage to keep busy. - 'Doin' what?' I have my interests. Polo, golf, tennis. - I paint a little. - Oh, you paint, do ya? Well, we got a truck outside that needs painting. Could you do that? It's not funny. What I want to know is what good are you gonna be in this racket? I might...test your liquor. I've had a drink or two in my time. Say, look here, am I supposed to join in this business with you? Well, the old man's croakin', ain't he? He's leaving the business to us. We've got to run it as partners, don't we? Say, what racket was you aiming at anyway? I wasn't aiming at any racket. I am going to be married and go abroad. A broad? Who is she? Huh? I suppose you want me to call her a "Girl." But I'll be shot if I can see the difference. Come on, we go see the old man. Let's go. Now, listen.. You ain't gonna act high-toned with the old man. He's your old man the same as he's mine whether you like it or not. He's dying, and he sent for you. And you're gonna act nice to him. You don't have to tell me what to do. Okay. I don't have to tell you what to do only you do what I tell you. Giacomo! My son.. Come here and sit by me.. ...Giacomo. It's been.. ...twenty years, my son. Twenty years, since I saw you. I.. I welcome you home. My friend Mario told me that you're a real gentleman. I am glad. Yeah. He's a gentleman alright, pop. He's got a broa.. Uh, I-I mean, he's got a girl and he's gonna get married. Can you beat that? What's the matter, does your chest hurt, pop? You want me and Giacomo to blow? No. Not Giacomo. I.. I wanna talk to him. Alright, pop. See ya downstairs. - Angela. - Si? Bring me that box you put away for me. I have a present for your girl, my son. If your mother were alive she'd be proud of you. It was her wish that you should live apart from us. She wanted you to be somebody. That's why I gave you to Giovanni Mario to bring you up. He has done...well. You.. Do you think she would like these? Why, sir.. ...they're beautiful. I wish you both much happiness, Giacomo. Thank you, sir. Oh. I think maybe Giacomo come tomorrow. You talk too much for your strength. Yes. We.. We will arrange everything tomorrow. Goodbye, sir. And.. Thank you for the, the emeralds.. ...father. This has gone as far as it goes. That guy Florio just about reached his limit. That makes three loads he's hijacked on us in two weeks. - What are you gonna do? - Plenty! That gorilla thinks he can get away with it, he's crazy. Was only a month ago he throws a feed fest. Everybody shook hands and kissed. Now, he hijacks some of my best stuff. Alright, Mike. Let you know later. You got anything on for tonight? Got a dinner engagement. With that high-hat dame of yours? Well, it's alright by me. Only you be back here by midnight. And bring your grips along. I want you here tonight in case the old man calls for you. Now, you seem to be takin' this pretty hard. It's all a little bit sudden. Hmm. I get ya. You don't like this racket. Well, to be frank with you that's alright with me. I didn't think you'd be any good at it anyway. Now, when the old man kicks him, there's gonna be close to a million bucks between us. Yeah. I'll get you 50 grand for a starter. You can marry that dame of yours. That will take you out of our lives and you can stay out. That'll be okay with all of us. That'll be okay with me, too. - Is that all? - That's all. You know, Angela.. Giacomo does look a little bit like me, don't he? What's the matter, is the old man worse? No, no, no, no. He gave those emeralds to Giacomo. I think-- - Giacomo? - Yes, you better tell him. Oh, he ain't here, he's gone. He won't be back till late. Never mind, Angela. New York's a big city, there ain't a chance in a million. Now, don't worry, go on. Darling, you've hardly said a word all during dinner. Am I beginning to bore you? No, no, of course not, dear. Did your guardian tell you something that upset you? Uh, a relative of mine is ill. Oh, I'm sorry. What's that book? It's for you. There's a verse in it that I rather liked. - Shall I read it to you? - Please. "Whether I live or whether I die "whatever the world that I see "I shall come to you by and by "and you will come to me. "Whoever was foolish, we were wise "we crossed the boundary line. "I saw your soul look out of your eyes you saw your soul in mine." I suppose you think that's very silly of me. No, I don't, dear. I think it's great. "Whatever the worlds I see "I shall come to you by and by and you will come to me." Do you really mean those words, Marjorie? That's why I bought the book. Don't ever forget them then. Thanks. Oh, Marjorie.. Why, Jack! Oh, they're beautiful. - They're for you. - For me? Oh, honey, they're the most exquisite emeralds I've ever seen. - Like them? - Like them? Well, I.. I'll have to whisper it to you. Oh, they're beautiful. Where did you get them? They're heirlooms. They've been in the family a long time. By the way, Marjorie.. I won't be able to see you for about a week. Not for a week? Oh, but, Jack, I wanted you to meet my family. We'll have to postpone it then. I'm going to Boston on business. And by the way, if.. ...if anything should come up during the week whereby you have to get in touch with me I'll leave you a phone number. If you call there, they'll relay a message to me. Aren't you being a little mysterious, Jack? Not really, dear. Ask for...Giacomo Tomasulo. He lives in Jersey City. - Tomasulo? - Hmm. I don't know anyone by that name. He doesn't live in your neighborhood, dear. I'll write it down for you. Waiter. Give me a pencil and some paper, please. Yes, sir. Thank you. Call Jersey City 2-4-6-4. I don't suppose you'll really need this number but just in case. The boys just unloaded five trucks. Is there anything else? Did you sample the whole load? I went through four trucks, but I couldn't see the last one. The stuff okay? Have you taken a good look at me? Yeah. You've had a hard day's work. You better go to bed. Hey! If you can see my brother tell him I want him. Right. You see Giacomo? He just left the old man. Maybe he's in his room. Gee, that old man likes to have him around. Yeah, at least he's good for that. Say, Mike, are you plastered? Plastered? Sister, I'm stuccoed. Well, you better go to bed before you explode. Right. Frank's lookin' for you. Thanks. Nuts? Yes? Sit down. Thanks. You don't have to hang around all the time. You've been here three days and ain't left the hotel once. Why don't you take one of the cars and play around New York? I don't feel like playing around New York. - If there's anything I can do.. - What could you do? Say.. How did your girl like them emeralds? Very much. Now, it ain't none of my business but how do you think she'd stand for it if she found out about this uh, racket? I don't think it's necessary for her to find out. Sure. Where does she come from? It's a coincidence. She lives here in Jersey City. Yeah? There's a gal on the phone, boss. She's all excited. She wants to talk to Giacomo. Who did you give this number to? Marjorie, in case anything happened. Well, it's happened. Get on that phone. Hello? Uh, is this Giacomo Tomasulo? I want to speak to Jack Thomas, please. Immediately. It's an emergency. Marjorie, this is Jack talking. Oh, Jack, I'm so glad. Where are you? I must see you at once. It's about those emeralds you gave me. Jack, they were stolen jewels. - Stolen? - Let me speak to her. They were stolen from a neighbor of ours. She sat next to me at a dinner party tonight. What shall I do, Jack? What shall I do? Uh, Marjorie, that's impossible. Gimme that phone. Hello, miss. Listen. This is Jack's brother. I can explain everything. You come down here right away. Yes, miss. If you wanna keep your pictures out of the paper you come right down here before anyone sees ya. What did you tell your folks? That's okay, sister. Hotel Ritzy. 2060, Canal Street. Got it? Now, make it fast, and come alone. We got a break. She ain't spilled nothin'. I won't have her down here. Well, she's comin' down here. You're not going to get her messed up in this. Well, I can fix it if you listen to me and do what I tell ya. What do you mean? You stole them emeralds. - I? - Yeah, you! Nothing doing. This isn't my show. Ain't it? Whose money kept you running with the swells? Whose son are ya? Oh, I know you never knew but get a load of this. If you don't take the rap, your old man's gotta take it. Is that alright with you? I have Marjorie to think of. Father may be alright. I haven't known him long enough to judge. I can't feel about him the way you do. He's gonna be kept out of this. He ain't gonna die with no cop's hand on his shoulder and he ain't gonna die in no jail. He's gonna die up there in that bed. Alright then, why don't you say you stole them? 'Cause I'm runnin' this racket. If you ever open your trap about gettin' them emeralds from the old man.. ...it'll just be too bad. I want to see Jack Thomas please. - Who? - Jack Thomas. Oh! You're the lady we're waitin' for, ain't ya? Sure, this way. Wanna check that coat, lady? Yeah? That lady's here, Frank. Let her in. - Marjorie. - Jack. Jack, what does this mean? What are you doing here? Where did you get those emeralds? Why don't you tell her, Giacomo? I'm going to. The truth. Who is this man? Why does he call you "Giacomo?" I'm his brother, miss. I call him Giacomo because that's his name. Brother? Where did you get those emeralds? Tell her. I intend to. Honey, they were.. Scusa. He's asleep now. I go to my room for a little rest. You will go in to see him later, si? Oh, he was so happy that you came tonight, Giacomo. You made him live longer. He loves you so. He was so happy to see you. So happy to see you. Well, what about those emeralds? I stole them. Jack.. Oh, honey, I know that sounds awful but everything's gonna turn out alright. That's right, lady. In a couple of days, he's gonna get 50 grand. Then you can go away and get married and forget all of this. Did you steal the 50,000 too? No. Our old man made that bootlegging. Oh, keep quiet. You're only making everything worse. No, he's making everything beautifully clear. I'm going straight to my father and tell him the truth. Will you get me a cab immediately? - Honey, you can't leave-- - I asked for a cab! Hey. You got a story to learn yet, miss. You gotta learn what to say about them emeralds. Make him let me go home. I tell you, I wanna go home at once! She's to go if she likes. Sure, only I'm goin' with her. - No, yo.. - No! - Jack! - Come on, come on. Let me go! Let me go! You can't do this! Let me go! Mike, keep an eye on Giacomo! I want him here when I come back. - Let me go! - Hey! Nice work. Hey, Mabel! Get some ice! Hey, ya hungry? Well, I thought maybe ya was 'cause every time I get socked on the chin I gotta eat. Maybe you're different though. He only socked you for your own good. Frank oughta be back any minute now. Maybe the dame was double-crossing ya. Alright, Mike. If you've done anything to Mar-- Oh, she's safe home. She gave me a note for you. Here. How do I know what you did to her after she wrote this? You don't. You'll know when the cops come. Story your dame's tellin' her old man now will have 'em down here lookin' for you any minute. Your girlfriend's got sharp teeth. Now, when the cops come don't crack. Let me make the speeches. That story we're tellin' is full of holes 'but it'll stand up if you keep your mouth shut.' If I get out of this you and I are gonna have a showdown. Why not? Oh, pinch ain't nothin'. When you get out, I'll give you that 50 grand I promised. Maybe by that time your girlfriend will have come to her senses, and you can still go away on your honeymoon. Tomasulo. Two seventy. Alright, Tomasulo, we're lettin' you out today. Didn't expect it to happen so soon, did ya? Well, it seems those charges against you were dropped. That's why you did only ten days instead of a good deal more. Come on down and get your clothes. Hey, Mike. Giacomo's gettin' out today. - Is his room ready? - Yeah. I guess he won't be hangin' around here much longer. When he comes in, send him up to my room. Right. - Well, you might take a look. - At what? - At me. - I've seen you. Oh, but I've got something you've never seen before. I don't wanna see it. It's a new dress I bought 'specially for you. I don't wear dresses. - Is that it? - Mm-hm. Where's your taillight? Oh, Mike, you're so mean lately. You never take me any place or anything. - I take you to the fights. - I know. Say, do you ever hear from that wife of yours in Philadelphia, PA? Nah. She just won't die, will she? If she died, you and I could get married, couldn't we? You got a lot of bright ideas this morning, haven't ya? Yeah, I, I feel pretty good. Say, you don't care for her anymore, do ya? She's dynamite. Well then, why don't you get her bumped off? Are you nuts? That's the trouble with you, Mike. You're too sentimental. Here's Giacomo. How's it feel to be breathing the fresh air aga... Well, what's the matter with him? - Where's Frank? - Upstairs. In his room. Gee, he's mad. Well, Giacomo.. Wasn't so bad, was it? They wouldn't take no bail on account of your name is Tomasulo. And I had to give the dame whose jewels was heisted ten grand to drop the char.. No big.. Now, cut it out, will ya? - Oh, let's cut it out. - I'm not through yet! Well, I am. Want a smoke? Here. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Would you like a drink? You sure got guts, Giacomo. Ah, don't take it so bad. I'm stronger than you. I guess I've been a kind of a wise guy at that snarin' at ya. Well, I take it all back. Oh, say, by the way, I got a note here for you. I guess it must be from your girl. You sure can put up a fight, boy. I guess maybe gentlemen ain't so bad. I just never understood one before, that's all. You're not so bad yourself. How's father? Died three days ago. Why wasn't I told? I came every day while you was in jail but you wouldn't see me. Funeral was yesterday. Did he suffer much? Oh.. I'm.. I'm sorry. Nothin' ya could do, kid. You done your share when you took the rap. Say, I got that 50 grand. You can have that now. She's gone away. I haven't any use for it now. She doesn't say anything about coming back either. Sure, she'll come back. If she cares as much for you as you do for her. Why don't you take your share of the dough and go back among the swells where you belong? Don't you see, Frank? I can never go back. Why not? Because.. ...I can never take my old place with my friends again. I'd be...living under false pretenses. Hmm? Oh, who'd know it? I'd know it. Then why don't you come into the racket with me? You could handle the Canadian end. They'd like you up there. Ya got a front, and ya talk like a gentleman. Yes, like a gentleman. Quit that. You're a gentleman now and you always will be one. Let's have a drink. Sure. Well, here's luck to you, kid. Here's luck to...both of us. You mean you..? Then let's drink to the new boss of the Canadian end. I wish this rain'd let up. Say, it's wetter than a seal's hips. Say, we should've loaded that stuff on scows and paddled back. Heat up the jam, honey. - Got any donuts? - Sure. Hey, Giacomo.. 'how do you like this racket?' Why, there seems to be a lot of water connected with this liquor business. You said it.. ...in more ways than one. Hey, I thought you were goin' up and handle the Canadian end? I told him to lay off this end of the racket but he insisted on comin' along tonight. See, I wanna learn this business from the ground level. There's Annie's coffee joint now. - 'How do we do this, Dante?' - We'll wait till they come out. Then you guys scatter and keep the cover. When they come over here, we'll stick 'em up. - That straight? - We got you. And leave Frank Tomasulo to me. That's Florio's orders. I'll take care of him. 'That gorilla's got it coming to him.' You two, grab the truck. The rest of you come with me. Okay, boys, on the trucks. Never mind, Giacomo, stay here and finish your java. I'll yell out when we're ready to start. - Here you are, Annie. - Thanks. Want some more coffee, Mr. Tomasulo? No, thank you. Well, there ain't no more anyway. They drunk it all up. If it ain't backfiring, it's hijackers. Maybe it's only backfiring. But I guess it ain't. Keep your hands up. Go on. Keep 'em up! Keep your hands up and keep your mouth shut. What about it, Dante? Well, I'll tell ya. Florio and me has been talking you over, Frank. We decided that you was a bad boy. We heard you was running liquor from Canada so Florio decided I'd better come up here and take it from you. Bit of old hijacking, huh? Well, I can take that on the chin. But bumping off my men is what I don't stand for. Well.. ...so long, Frank. Take care of the boys! Don't worry about it. It's raining. They'll erase it. Now, remember what I said, there's no rounds to be carried to Tomasulo's ball on Friday night. It's supposed to be a peace banquet. A dame to haul the artillery. Hey, Florio. Are you really going to make up with that guy Tomasulo? Sure. The hard way. When I get done with the little job I gotta figured out that guy'll be coming to me squealin' quits. What's the gig? I've found out who bumped off Dante. - What? Who? - Yeah. That high-hat brother of Frank Tomasulo's, Giacomo. And that guy's gone on the spot. Hey, Frank, get this. A dame from Florio's mob blows in tonight. - What's that? - Yeah. And she's up in Angela's room now. - Swingin' into a bowl of soup. - What do you know about her? Enough to know that she ain't on the level. She used to be Dante's girl. - Dante's girl? - Yeah, and her name's Ruth. Tell Angela to bring her down here. I'm tellin' ya, that tomato ain't on the up and up. Alright, alright. Go on. Okay. Hey, Angela! Frank wants you and that chameleon you got in there to come on downstairs! Yes? Where's that girl? Poor little girl, she come here. She don't mean no harm. Florio sent her to find out where's Giacomo. Oh, I guessed that much. What do you want me to do, give her a medal? - I'll speak to her-- - Oh, no, no, no, no. Not tonight, please. She's so tired. Tomorrow morning. Leave her alone tonight. - Please, Frank? - Alright. Peace banquet for Florio, huh? And he's out to get Giacomo. Alright, Angela, goodnight. Goodnight. Happy dreams. Hello. Give me Western Union. Hello, Western Union? Take a wire. Mr. G. Tomasulo. - Okay, I gotta have a hammer-- - Well, get a hammer. Hey! This joint looks like a hothouse! Hey, what are you dolled up so early for? Oh, I'm strikin' it in for tonight. Hey, Mike, have you heard from that wife of yours in Philadelphia, PA? She's in a burlesque show, doin' a dance. - Oh. - Mm! That don't so good to me. She ain't to be trusted. I don't like it either. But that's the way Fanny is. She'd never listen to me. Do you know that's grounds for divorce? You just tell the judge you ain't got no control over your Fanny, and you'll get rid of her. - Yeah? - 'Hello, Giacomo.' - Hey, there's Giacomo. - 'Giacomo, how ya been?' - Hello, Giacomo. - Hello. Hello, Mabel. - Hello! - Hello, Mike. Hello, Giacomo. We were just talkin' about you. - You look great. - We're glad to have you back. - How did you like Canada? - Great. - Frank in his office? - Yeah, go right in. - I'll take your grips upstairs. - Oh, thanks. - He looks swell. - I'll say he does. Giacomo! How are you, boy? - Well, Frank. - Glad to see you. You're lookin' swell. - Sit down. - Thanks. You certainly done fine. I am proud of you. It's an interesting business. I told you you'd like it. I didn't say, "I like it," I said, "It's interesting." Hey, what's all the big doing out in the lobby you redecorating the place? No. We're throwin' a banquet tonight. You better get your soup and fish out. - For whom? - For Florio. It's another one of those get-together parties. Oh, I know it's a lot of baloney but we stand to win more than we stand to lose. Do I have to attend? Well, you're my brother, ain't you? It'd look funny if you didn't come. How's Florio going to take my being here? 'He'll take it and like it.' Now, I don't like to have that guy around here no more than you do. He's poison. But tonight there's gonna be a showdown. I think I understand. Oh, oh. There's something else you got to do. Now, in the room next to yours there's a girl. I want you to go in and say hello to her. She's a kid named Ruth and-and you're gonna sit with her at the table. Do I have to do that? Why not? Some things in you die pretty hard, don't they? There's one thing in me that'll...never die at all. Did you know she went to England? Yeah. I read about it. But that's not far away. People come back from England. Go in and see this kid anyway, will you? Who is she? Well, she used to be Dante's girl. Frank, are you crazy? Yeah, like a fox. Listen, this kid blows in here about a week ago with a story about how Florio's mob is treatin' her rough. But Angela gets wise, and treats her nice. And the kid spills the beans. Florio had sent her over here to find out where you was. Yeah, that was a set up. But she's one of us now. Solid. You looking for trouble, Frank? Sure, I am. I like it. Florio is gonna boil up plenty when he sees you and her together. Well, let him boil. That's my way of showin' him who's boss. But if he wants peace, he can have it.. ...my way. Catch on? Okay. I'll be, uh, seeing you later, huh? Hello, Meyers. Just in time for the big spread. What's all this, a boilermakers' convention? Nah, just a little banquet. - You know? - Come clean. What's it all about? All these are Florio's men. Sure. I'm throw this brawl for him. This is a peace banquet. Look, Meyers.. you ain't got no call to clear nothin'. I've always run this place on the level, ain't I? Yeah, but how do you know it ain't gonna end up in gunplay? Why should it? Of course, if you wanna have a mob of cops here snoopin' around, I can't stop ya. See you later. Come in. Marjorie! Marjorie? Oh, say, are you Frank's brother? Yes. But didn't he tell you my name was Ruth? Yes, he did. But you said Marjorie. You reminded me of someone I knew one time. Her hair was golden like yours. Say, how would you like a drink? Frank sent me up a thermos of Manhattans. Want one? Thank you. And you? Oh, I don't care for booze much. But if you want me to take one, why.. No, no. Not if you don't like it. You know, Frank's been awful good to me. Oh, he sent out to a store and bought me this dress. I like it 'cause it's black, don't you? Very much. I think black is swell. Say.. Do I look funny in it? No, no, no. You remind me of a girl I knew, that's all. Oh. Oh, you're not drinking. Did anyone ever tell you that you're a lovely-looking child? No. No. Not in just that way. Well, you are. Thanks. I got your orders. And if anything happens.. ...you take care of Florio, see. Sit down, kid, don't get nervous. This is a peace banquet. - Hello, pal! - Hello, Frank. - Hello, Florio. - Hello, Mike. - Hello, Florio. - Hello, Butch. - Hi. - Hello, Frank. - Glad to see you. - So am I. Sit down, boys. Sit down. Mike, go out and see if everything is ready for the boys. Right. Have a drink, Florio. Oh, yeah. Say, it's good to see you again, Frank. You're lookin' great. Glad to see you. - Come on, boys, have a drink. - Sure. Well.. - Here's how! - Okay. Say, Frank.. I hear that brother of yours is doin' pretty good. - When's he gettin' back? - What do you know? He goes and crosses me up and he's back now. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, I'd kinda like to meet him. You'll meet him. He's gonna be at the dinner tonight. That'll be nice. Oh, say, remember that, uh, moll I told you about over the phone the other day? A little blonde. Has she been around? A blonde? Say, Florio.. We ain't got nothin' but blondes around this dump. How do you expect me to know which one you mean? Everything's all set, boss. Tell Giacomo we'll be in for the eats in ten minutes. Say, boys, wait till you meet this kid brother of mine. You'll go crazy about him. Frank says they'll be downstairs in ten minutes. Hey, Mike. What? - Here. - Thanks. Wait a minute. Go down to the corner and get me a corsage of orchids. Orchids? For her? This lady's name is Ruth. Kindly call her by her name when you talk about her. Right. Okay, boss. I'll get the orchids for her. You know, you didn't have to do that if you didn't want to. I did want to, Jack. Hey! Everybody! Come and get it! Hello, baby. Hey, Mike, nice tomato you got here. That ain't no cauliflower you got. Hey, stop talkin' about his ears. There's nothin' in it. Hey, waiter! Bring Mike an artichoke with somethin' in it. You know, Frank would pull a gag like this. Well, there better be somethin' in mine. Well, it certainly looks as if you put out plenty for the food. Hey, nothin' too good for my friends, Florio. Yeah, that's the way I feel too. Hey, Frank. You know, this peace banquet was a great idea. Sure. I get good ideas once in a while. It's about time we put this racket on a business basis. Between us we could run this town. Yeah. Bumpin' each other off. What does it get us? A lotta swell funerals. Say, what're you drivin' at, pal? Just this. From now on, our mobs work together. - Kinda hand-in-hand like, huh? - Sure. And I'll split, uh, 50-50 with you in my west side territory. Say, that sounds swell. Where's the catch, Florio? I want the guy who bumped off Dante. Oh, eat your turkey. I'm talkin' turkey, not eatin' it. That guy's hot, see? Oh, yeah, I see. Say, what the.. This way, Giacomo. Hey, that's Dante's girl. I want you to meet my kid brother Giacomo. Giacomo, this is Florio. - How do you do? - Hi. You two ain't never met before. No. But I met his girlfriend plenty of times. Aren't you going to eat? Why, yes. Yeah. I met her plenty of times. Now, to get back to business-- Say, I heard you've done good in Canada or Florida. Hear you're gettin' to be a big businessman like your brother. That's great. Thanks. Say, did you ever meet my brother-in-law? Last winter, one night up on a border? Never heard of your brother-in-law. May I help you to something? His name was Dante. - Don't know him. - Here's the orchids. Thanks. May I? I heard you met him. Who told you that? Oh, they're beautiful. You've heard of Dante, haven't you? You're spilling wine on your shirt front. I like it that way. Sure, you knew him. You knew him pretty well, too, didn't ya? Heard he used to beat you up whenever you needed it. Pretty flowers ya got on. Suits you fine too. Make you look clean. Didn't think any flower could clean up a moll like you. You're drunk, Florio. - Is that so? - Yes. You dirty, squealin' moll! Nix! The bulls! Look who's here. And the party's just breakin' up. Peace banquet, huh? Why, it's a love feast. Well, so long, pal. I'll be seein' you. Yeah, so long. You and the fellas come over my way sometime. Always be glad to see ya. Sure, we'll be over almost anytime. Thanks for the present. - I owe you something. - Not at all. It's a pleasure. Goodnight, everybody. I hope yous all enjoyed the party. Eh, boys, will you see the guests safe to the door? I'll take Ruth to her room. Hey, Frank, that was a great gag you used puttin' nothin' in the artichokes. I'm sorry, Ruth. Goodnight, Ruth. Well, kid, ya certainly buried that peace banquet under a bouquet of orchids. Have a drink? No, thank you. Tired? Mm, a little bit. Why don't you go hit the hay? I think I will. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Giacomo. Hey, Frank, how much money have I got? A whole lot. Why? Would you mind, Frank if...I.. If you quit the racket? It's not.. I don't like it, Frank. I see. I get to feelin' that way sometimes too. It'll pass off. Go get some sleep. Maybe you'll think different in the morning. She oughta be coming back pretty soon now. I'd kinda like to prepare my mind for it. You know how I feel about you. If it weren't for Marjorie I'd stick it out just because you wanted me to. She ain't comin' back. She ain't that kind of a dame. You don't know her. I know her alright. It's you that don't know her. There. Think I'll take that drink now, Frank. Getting drunk's a good idea sometimes. Yes, it is. Can you imagine, Frank? I thought she'd wait for me. Everything I did was because I thought she'd come back to me. Maybe you better lay off that booze for a while, kid. And I'm waiting for her. I'm working toward getting her back to me. I run booze. I kill a man. Because nothing else matters except.. ...she's coming back to me sometime. And she.. She goes and gets married. Come on, Frank. Let's go upstairs and tell Ruth. Tell her what? That she and I are getting married. - Come on, Frank. - Don't be dumb, Giacomo. You don't have to marry that girl. Certainly I have to marry her. Everybody's gettin' married. Ruth and I are gonna get married. Come on, Frank. I will come to you.. Giacomo, no! Don't, Giacomo! Giacomo, no. Oh, Mabel, isn't it marvelous? Goin' all around the world. Yeah. The farthest I ever went was, was Paterson. Gee, I'm lucky. Married to a swell guy and now Frank's sending us on a honeymoon trip all around the world. Mine never takes me places. I was crazy about him but he doesn't seem to care about me at all. Or maybe he's just hiding his feelings, Mabel. Yeah, I guess, he hid 'em someplace where he couldn't even find 'em himself. I got a beautiful wreath picked out for him though. A wreath. What for? In case he gets bumped off. I hope he don't, but I always think it's a good thing to be prepared. It's got red roses on it too. Red roses? Sure. They stand for passion. And that's the way I feel about Mike. But it don't seem to get me nowhere anyway. - Want a chip? - No, thanks, honey. - They're awful good for ya. - Yeah, I know. Do you know the only thing I can't eat is popcorn? - Oh, I'm sorry. - So am I. Now, get this set. I'm going to do the shootin' myself and it's that squealin' moll Ruth I wanna get first. And when that guy Giacomo gets in, he goes next. Yeah. - Forelli. - Yes, sir? Fill 'em up again. And leave the bottle here. I think the best time to pull the job will be around ten o'clock tonight. Who are they after? Ten o'clock tonight, Mike. I just heard them talking. The girl Ruth first, then Giacomo. Florio is going to handle the gun. Okay. Yes, I'll give you the grand tomorrow. Thanks for the tipoff. Well, it worked. I knew that guy was a squealer. They'll be expecting us at ten o'clock tonight. So, we'll fool 'em. We'll go now. Come on. - And that's how I got the dope. - Are you sure it ain't a plant? No, boss. I'm paying Forelli a grand tomorrow for the tipoff. Ten o'clock. What time is it? Six hours more. This is where I take Mr. Florio. If I knock him off now I got a swell alibi. Self-defense. - Where's Giacomo? - I ain't seen him all day. You know, you can get all the liquor you want on them places on the other side. Can you imagine a country without bootlegging? Gee, I'd sure feel funny. You don't want me to help you out, do you? No, thanks, honey. I think I can do the rest of it myself. Do you mind if I run over to the Ritzy for a few minutes? No, go right ahead. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You better keep your doors locked. Don't forget what Frank told you. No, I won't. The dame's alone. Cover here. - Frank! - What is it, Ruth? Well, Florio's car is outside, and Tony is with him. - Did you see Giacomo? - I mean, no. I-I beat it down the alley. - He's walkin' right into it. - They've crossed us. Come on! - Who is it? - Laundry, madam. Hello, Ruthy. Surprised to see me? I just thought I'd drop in. See how you're gettin' along. Well, nice-lookin' joint you got here. Yeah, nice joint. Well, ain't you gonna ask me to sit down? Alright. I'll sit down myself. Hey, how would you like a little drink? Yeah, it's a good idea. So, you keep your drinks in the bedroom, huh? That's a funny place to keep booze. You're not tryin' to get away from me are you, sweetheart, by any chance? Why, of course not. So, Frank was sending you on a trip. Well, sweetheart, you're still goin' on a trip. Only I'm sending you. You rat. - Ruth, are you hurt? - I'm alright. That's what I call close. Come on, kids. I had to bump off Tony. Flash got away. He's tellin' his mob by now, come on! - Giacomo! - Jack! Jack. Jack. - Giacomo, where did it get you? - Jack! What? I'll wait. It's all my fault, Giacomo. I got you into this. No. It's great to have been with you, Frank. You and.. ...Ruth.. ...are real. Get out of the racket, Frank. The rotten racket. Sure we will. We'll get out. You and me and Ruth. I am getting out.. ...now. Take care of my wife, Frank. That's orders.
