Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Julian, old fellow! - Paul! - Oh, my, you're looking splendid. - You too, Paul, and you're thinner. - Oh, really, you noticed it? Yes. Diet, exercise. Cut out all sweets, all starches. And twenty-five rolls every morning. Oh, and how many cups of coffee? Oh, no, no, honestly... Susie, Susie... Susie! Porter! Susie! Where are... oh! Come dumpling. Come! Oh, porter, will you get my bag? Thank you. Julian, Miss Susie Flamberg. Julian de Lussac. How do you do? Susie, you can get up now. As I was about to say, Susie is related to the Flamberg millions. - Hm, all of them? - Oh, it's her father. And she is my fianc?e. Well, how fortunate. Yes, fortunate that it isn't true. I've told you time and again that I am not your fianc?e. Oh, well, you can't hang a man for hoping. When did they pass that law? I'll get the car. Oh, your tie. Nice trip? Yes. Glad to be back in Paris? Yes. How was Chile? Yes. - I said how was Chile. - Oh, Chile was fine. Oh. And the native women, how were they? Yes, Chile. Chilly? Chile was fine. A little hot. How could it be hot when it's chilly? Hush, dumpling. - Make any money? - No, but I will. No, but you will? How? I bought an option on a nitrate concession. Really? Smart! Worth a fortune. Really? Very smart. Took every sou I had. Really? Hm, what was that? Mercedes. - You know her? - It's the make. Yes, she smiled. Paul was referring to the body. Hush, dumpling. You were about to pass a lady in distress. Anything wrong? Yes, uh... Your tie needs straightening. Thanks. No, the other way. Thanks. No, that's too far. May I? Thanks. There. I think that's better. - All right? - Perfect. She's a... Hush, dumpling! Falling in love again, never wanted to... What am I to do? Falling in love again, never wanted to... What am I to do? Falling in love again, never wanted to... What am I to do? Can't help it! - Everything ready, Albert? - Quite, sir. I've just selected the necktie. Which one? Not the one you've been wearing for the last ten days, sir. And I'm going to wear it for the next ten years. - Or until I can find out her last name. - Yes, sir. Oh, and Albert, the shaving mirror is all steamed up again. Yes, sir. - I beg your pardon, sir. - Yes? - Would you mind? - Mind? Mind what? Albert, you're a genius! Oh, thank you, sir. Ha, but our big invention, how is that coming? It's ready, sir. All but the motor. Why don't you go out and buy a motor? You... - I mean, we have no money, sir. - Well, go out and charge a motor. - Oh, thank you, sir. - Not at all. - Will you look now? - Yes, right away. All set, Albert? Yes, sir. - That's the button on the desk, sir. - Oh, yes. It isn't connected yet. If you just pretend that it is and... sort of press it, I'll sort of pretend I'm the motor. Of course. - Are you ready? - Yes, sir. - Did you press the button? - No, go ahead. Go! - Excellent! - Thank you, sir! Listen to this. A thunderstorm. It's not raining on my side of the building. Really? I'll go out immediately, sir, and get the motor. - Splendid, Albert, splendid. - Thank you, sir. Julian, what's the meaning of all this nonsense? Paul, have you ever had a lady visit your apartment at the classic hour of 5:00? 5:00? Why, yes, I think I have. Yes, and haven't you always found that she must be home by 5:45? - Yes, I think I have. - Yes, you know you have. Why, it's happening all over Paris between 5:00 and 5:45. Really? Well, well, well. What is? Men are racking their brains to find arguments to hold their fair visitors. But I? I simply press my little button. Boom! There is a loud clap of thunder. She's frightened. She clings to me. A quarter to six is quite forgotten. - Julian, you're a genius. - Thank you, sir. What time is it? Oh, I don't know. I never know. It's 4:50. Late as all that? Time to fly. Oh. For whose benefit is all that? Not that woman who straightened you out in her car? - You're putting it a bit crudely. - Oh, come now, you're old enough to face life. - Is it she? - Yes. - Hm... You see her often? - Not often enough. A little thing a belle gets. - Well, well... hm. What's her name? - Marguerite. - Marguerite what? - Oh, I don't know. - You don't know? No, all she'd tell me was her first name and her telephone number. Well, if you know her telephone number it shouldn't be difficult to find out her last name. You think so? Try it. Did you ever go through a telephone directory page by page? No. But I'm reading Anthony Adverse. Well, then you know what I mean. I'm now at the letter 'C'. At the Cohen's. - I've been there for some time. - A charming family. But Julian, do you think this is a time for philandering? I mean with all your debts and everything. Well, I still have this option on the Chilean nitrate concession, haven't I? - Oh, that thing. - Oh, yes, hm-hm. - When does your option expire? - In a week. Then you'll have nothing. Paul, do you want to get in on a good thing? I think I'll be going. Paul! This concession is worth a fortune. Yes? Well... I still think I'll be going. - Oh, Julian! - Yes? Oh, I forgot what I came for. No, no, no, I remember, yes. I'm giving a little cocktail party in my apartment. - Nice place for it. - Yes, And Susie... Miss Susie Flamberg, you remember? I remember her glasses. Well, she sent me up here to ask you to join the party. - Well! - May I tell her you can't come? - Certainly. - Thank you. Hello, hello? Yes, this is... Marguerite, my darling, where are you? Where? What? Never see you again? But what... But Marguerite, we can't separate yet. Why... I don't even know your last name. What? Say that again. All right. If that's your last word, here's mine. You might not believe this, Marguerite, but I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking the gun out of the drawer. I'm pointing it at my head. I love you, Marguerite. And now I'm pulling the trigger. Good bye! There was a shot, sir. Oh, it's quite all right, Albert. I just committed suicide. Then you'd like to be alone, sir. Yes, do your marketing. I don't know how long it will take her to get here. Let me in! Let me in! - She must live in the building, sir. - She must live next door. Oh, Albert. Let her in on your way out. Don't answer any questions, just point to this room. Yes, sir. Let me in! - Oh, and Albert, Albert... - Yes, sir. - Try to look wistful. Yes, sir. Darling! Where are you? Oh, how terrible. If only I thought you'd meant it I could have said something, but... it was all so quick and... He's alive! Who are you? - Who are you? - Nobody. Let me go, please. - Haven't I seen you before? - No. Please let me go! Oh, no, not without... Hey. Not without an explanation. - You called me darling. - I thought you were dead. Do I know you? No. But I know you. I know everything about you. - Don't be silly. - It's true. All right. What was I doing yesterday afternoon? You were At the races. You bet on Cr?pe Suzette in the third event... and won at 9 to 1. Then you stopped at the telephone exchange... and asked the manager for the last name of a lady subscriber. No luck, so you went home. Exact! To the last detail. And now I must go. Oh, oh, what's all your hurry? You intimated that you love me. Will you say one more thing for me? - What? - Call me darling again? You're not dead anymore. Oh. How did you know I killed myself? - Do you live with that artist next door? - I do not. I live by myself. And yet you know exactly how I spend my days. And nights. Oh, really? What are you, my guardian angel? No. I'm your telephone operator. What? I run the switchboard for these apartments. You run the... Well, this calls for cocktails. Please. You see, all telephone operators listen a little. Hm, I've often wondered. - Will you? - Thank you. But, uh... what made you take such a special interest in me? Just curiosity at first. So many women called you I thought, well... they must be attracted by... something. Oh, thank you. But then I realized this attraction was also your great misfortune. Because women can sculpt you just as they please. - You mean scalp. - No, I mean sculpt. Why, I've never been sculpt. Oh, yes you have, You see... You're potty. What? Yes, it's a pity, but you're potty. Oh, thank you again. But very nice potty. Tell me... When did you decide that I was potty? The day you broke with ?toile 2178 for ?lys?e 2670. - That night I cried. - For ?toile 2178? No, for you. That was very considerate. ?toile 2178 was obviously a scatter-brained little fool. But she wasn't a cold-blooded schemer like ?lys?e 2670. Yes, you know, you're perfectly right. I spent everything I had on ?lys?e 2670. You might have warned me. You wouldn't have listened. Any more than you'd listen now if I were to warn you against Marguerite Cintos. Cintos? Oh, I forgot you didn't know her last name. I mean, the lady you killed yourself for. - You know her? - Hm-hmm. Her name is Marguerite Cintos. And she and her husband live at 79, Avenue Victor Emmanuel. They're South American. Her husband is of good family, but not such good reputation. - He shot a man he caught cheating. - Hm? - At cards. - Oh. Madame Cintos' uncle was a soap manufacturer. How the devil did you learn all that? I dropped in to see a switchboard operator. Oh, and she said that... That Marguerite Cintos was a DD. - Doctor of Divinity? - No! Definitely Dynamite. Oh, I see. Her horn! She's here. She stopped to argue about a place to stop... while you lie bleeding to death from a bullet wound. Good bye. Hey, hey, here! Wait a minute. - When am I gonna see you again? - Why? Well, I don't even know your name. It's Anna. Anna Mirelle. - Now you won't have to see me again. - But... There she is. Mind letting her in? I'll let her in, but she won't like it. Nevertheless, you'll have to let her in. I'm dead, you know. Definitely dynamite. Julian! Stop acting and get up. I know you're all right. - How do you know? - That girl just told me. Oh, she did? Marguerite! Marguerite, I uh... Suppose my husband found me here. Se?or Cintos? You know my name? Hm-hmm. And I also know that you live at er... 79, Avenue Victor Emmanuel. And that you once had an uncle who manufactured soap. What else? Just soap, wasn't it? You hired a detective. Oh, no, no. I just met the Encyclopedia Britannica. Who? Marguerite, day and night I've pictured you in this room. And now you're actually here. I can only stay a few minutes. I've got to be home by, er... a quarter to six. You know, someday Albert's gonna fix that. Then those are going to be the happiest moments of my life. - Your husband is downstairs! - Julian! - Is his name Julian, too? - No, Ram?n. Whatever it is he's coming up and you're going out. Oh, no! If you hurry, you can just get out of the apartment before he gets here. No, I'd meet him on the stairs. He'd shoot me. I'll have to hide in there. Wait a minute! That's the bedroom. He'll shoot me, that's the first place he'll look. Don't let him. But you... Oh, good afternoon. Is there something I can do for you? Oh, the poker. I was just going to make a little fire... - My name is Cintos. - Oh, how do you do, Mr. Cintos? Where is my wife? - Wife? - Yes, where is the bedroom? The bedroom? Do you wish to wash? Oh, yes, yes, my cocktail. Two, eh? Oh, I always drink them in pairs. Will you have a couple? - Where is the bedroom? - It's er... No, no, that's not it. That's the er... Se?or, se?or... I apologize! She's beautiful! I congratulate you. Is he gone? Anna, how did you get here? Through the hall door. It wasn't locked. Where did you put her? Anna, wait a minute. I wanna thank you. - How did you think of it? - Well, it struck me that... Marguerite! Marguerite, darling. You see, if that man Julian does not go with you... our plan is ruined. He will be here any moment. I'll get him out of town. And I'll keep him out of town until his nitrate option expires. Good. I'll make him forget about business. - Marguerite! I trust you. - Why not? But if you do forget me while you're with him... I am going to... Stop bending my nail file. And stop worrying. You'll be right near us. Yes... yes. Marguerite, I trust you. It's Julian. Remember. You are very sad. You want to get away from me because you hate me. Say you love me. Marguerite, I trust you. Remember. You hate me. Darling, why did you send for me? - My husband. - Where is he? Out. He's insanely jealous. Yes, I noticed that. Julian, we must go away. - Did you say 'we'? - You said you loved me. Of course I do. We'll get married. We'll go to Nice. We'll get you a divorce. Kiss me. I'll get the reservations. I can hardly wait. Unfasten my dress. Lorraine Apartments. One moment, please. Anna, I love you. Lorraine Apartments. Yes? No, madam, your son's in bed with a headache. Lorraine Apartments. Anna, I love you. One moment, please. - Why don't you say you love me? -' You've been disconnected. Because I love someone else. Is it that man that comes to fix the switchboard, the big fellow? No, Henry. It's someone much bigger. Hm... He's so big that it's very silly of me to have fallen in love with him at all. Why don't you forget him? Henry, you're hungry. Why don't you go and get yourself a nice veal cutlet? Anna, I love you more than any veal cutlet in the world. Lorraine Apartments. Oh, Ad?le. Go away, please, this is very important. - But... - Go away! Ad?le, any news? Yes, he phoned from here and made reservations for two. The maid said Mrs. Cintos is also packing. No, that's all I could find out. - Ad?le, can't you... - Falling in love again, never wanted to... - I'll call you later. - ...what am I to do? I can't help it! Oh, so this is where you live. - Good evening. - Hello. I hear you're leaving town. Where did you learn that? - Can't hear you. - I said, where did you learn that? At the Swedish Embassy. - Oh, thanks. - You're welcome. Look here, don't you think you're going pretty far? Yes, I know I am. But I've just found out... I know, you've just found out that I'm going away with Mrs. Cintos and do I know what I'm doing. But that's just it, you don't. - And you do. - Yes. Cintos and his wife are planning something crooked. - Prove it. - Well, I can't now but... - I know I'm right. - Oh, rubbish! Do you know what you are? You're a snoop. A meddlesome, jealous little snoop. And if you don't stay out of my affairs, I'll speak to the manager and have you fired, you understand, fired. All right, have me fired, but please listen first. Hello? No, he isn't. He's gone. He doesn't answer. I don't know. He didn't say. He doesn't answer. Maybe. Mercadet 8200. This is Mr. Julian de Lussac's trained nurse. Calling Susie Flamberg. That's right. Albert! Albert! Albert! Hello, Albert... Anna? Miss Mirelle. Have you seen Albert? Of course I want him. I want him to pack! Oh, I'm sorry. I told him you said he could take the night off. - You told him? - My mistake. Excuse it, please. Hello! Anna! Hello! Come in! - Oh, hello. - How do you feel? I'm fine. You should lie down. What? Come. Oh... Look here. How did you know about my accident? Your trained nurse told me. - My trained nurse? - She telephoned. - Oh, she telephoned. - Where were you hit? Why er... Oh, you can tell me quite frankly. I'm a modern girl. Oh, that. A mere trifle. Did you come to see Paul? I'll tell him you're here. You're delirious. - We'd better go in and lie... - How are you? But I understood you had an accident. That you shot yourself. Oh, nothing serious. The bullet just loosened my plaster. But... But you were unconscious. Oh, I know. The trained nurse told you. Yes, and she also told me what you said when you were unconscious. Oh, indeed? And what did she said... say I said? She said you'd keep calling for me. - Oh, did I? - Yes. That's why I'm here. Doodlebug. Doodle...? Miss Flamberg! Call me Susie. - Oh, that's a little er... - Julian, you think of everything. My dear! Night after night I dream I'm falling... over suitcases and that you are holding me in your arms. crushing me to a pulp. - Susie! - Do you know what I mean? Yes, just like squeezing a lemon. Yes, it means that I really want to be crushed. - To a pulp? - To a pulp. I'll speak to Paul about it! It's my approach that bothers you. You know, Julian, I do believe you're just a wee bit old-fashioned. Yes, I'm just beginning to realize it. But I think that's charming. I suppose flirting has its effects. - Shall I take off my glasses? - No! All right. - Now we're not frightened, are we? - No... oh I... Kiss me, doodlebug. Susie! - Papa! - Papa? So it's true! Is it? - Susie, my only child! - Don't be dramatic, Papa. - You're too stout. - I've lost four lbs. As for you, young man! My dear sir, I assure you your daughter is non compos mentis. Well, if she is, you'll answer for it. No, she's absolutely innocent. - Is that true? - Yes, Papa. Temporarily. Then why did you take her glasses off? And what about her visits here every afternoon at 5 o'clock? - What? Why she... - Now, don't lie! I have a full account of all your meetings. Oh, you have, did she? That training nurse. I'll disconnect her! I'll pull her plugs out! - I'll tear her switchboard apart! - Mr. de Lussac! How soon can you marry my daughter? Three weeks from tomorrow, Papa. That's not soon enough. I know it isn't, but it's as soon as the law will allow. Then that's what it's going to be. I'll answer it, dear. Oh, dear. Did you hurt yourself? Sit down on the chair there, my dear. Put your glasses on and see if you're hurt. - You've got your hat on. - Huh? Hello... Yes, this is... An option on the nitrate concession? Yes, yes, immensely valuable. No, up to the moment, no. Mr. de Lussac, I represent a very important syndicate. We are prepared to offer you for a half interest in your concession, one million francs. - One million francs for half interest? - Don't give him an answer now. I want to discuss it with you. I'm very sorry, but I can't give you an answer now. You see, I want to discuss it with my er... Fianc?e's' father. Father... fianc?e! Oh. My father's fianc?e. - What? - Yes, it's Anna. I arranged everything. No, that was Henry. The doorman. What happened? Who was it? - Doorman. - Who? Mr. Doorman. Henry Doorman. I never heard of him. That's funny. He has very big interest in the street. - He often let me in on the ground floor. - Yes, I should like to meet him. You probably will. He seems to know a lot about you. I daresay. Yes, he said that if you got in on this nitrate deal... we'd all die in the poor house. Poor house, eh? Let me tell you something. If that concession is all you say it is, you'll have enough money to support a dozen wives. Papa! Here's a description of the property with full reports and mineral tests. And how long is this option to run? Well, the first payment must be made at the Chilean Consulate - ...by noon, Monday. - I see. Julian. Were you going away somewhere? Oh, just a little trip, three days... business. Go away now, will you, doodlebug? Sulian! Jusie! Hello, Paul, old fellow. - Aren't you going to congratulate us? - Congratulate? Yes, we're going to be married two weeks from tomorrow. - Well. How about me? - Oh, you're included. As the best man. Isn't he, Julian? Mr. Flamberg, I... Are you going to back him and his nitrate concession? I suppose I am. So, that's it. You deliberately deceive this defenseless little dumpling to save your nonsensical nitrates. He didn't. His nitrates came up quite by accident. Julian, I must ask a question. Not until he answers mine. What about those 5:00 visits? Don't lie, darling. We confess. That settles it. Tomorrow's papers will carry the announcement. - Oh... - Oh... That's a papa! Thunder! - Come, Susie. - A thunderstorm. Oh, dear, think how romantic it might have been if we could've... Dumpling! Dumpling! - Paul, I... - You, you monster! You unspeakable... nitrate! Hello, hello, Anna? Anna went out. Well, tell her the minute she comes in to... So, you are at home. Oh, Marguerite, darling, why in heaven's name couldn't you have come sooner? Your telephone girl said you weren't here. I... Naturally. Your door is smashed. Were you injured? Permanently. - Where? - Marguerite... I'm about to become a husband. - What? - I've been trapped. I'm going to marry a girl I don't love. - I don't think even her father loves her. - Why marry her? Well, Mr. Flamberg thinks I took her glasses off. Come with me tonight. Julian. - What do you want? - I've come to fix your door. Come back later. I can't do any hammering after 10:00. Then come back in the morning. Anna thought I'd better fix it now. Just enough so people won't come walking in. Anna thought. Anna thinks of everything. Yes, sir. Oh, I suppose you'd better go home. I can't go home. I left a note telling my husband I was leaving him. You did what? That's what you told me to do. Oh, call your home, get the maid, get anybody, get everybody but get them hide that note before your husband finds it. Come on, call her, call the maid. Here. Hello? Trudaine 7815, please. Stop that hammering, I can't hear a thing. Hey! Telephone. - For me? - Quiet! - But Anna thought I ought... - Oh, quiet! Ram?n, listen. He won't go. It's that Flamberg girl. He's going to marry all those millions? Don't talk. Come over here. Yes, Marie. You sure he found the note? Oh... thank you, Marie. It's too late. He's got it. Well, tell him it was a joke. He has no sense of humor. Marguerite... Marguerite, where are you going? Margueri... May I go on with my hammering now? Anna thought... You better go downstairs and watch the switchboard. Anna. I suppose you came up to receive thanks for the beautiful way you've arranged my life. No. Cintos and his wife are framing you. - Again? - They're trying to ruin you. They can't. You've already done it. What do you mean? Thanks to you, tomorrow morning the Flambergs will publicly announce my engagement to their daughter. I suppose there still are a few problems to be worked out. You must be psychic. Wait a minute, I... Hello. - Oh, it's you. - Hm-hmm. I just had to call you, darling. I'm in bed. Are you, really? Well, tuck yourself in. And kiss yourself good night. - How... how do you do? - I have received a note from my wife. - Really? I didn't know she'd gone away. - She hasn't. - And what's more, she's not going to. - Sorry I mentioned it. Listen, my friend, the law says you must pay for stealing a man's wife. So I have come to collect. - How much? - Oh, it isn't money. You will sign this paper. - Wait a minute! - Sit down! But this gives you all the rights to all my nitrate option. Exactly. - I won't sign it. - No? I think you will. Sorry. Yeah, Anna was right, all right. - As right as a trivet. - What? - Trivet. - What's that? Oh, I don't know. I never looked it up. Are you going to sign? Well, since you put it that way. What's that? - Sounded like thunder. - Ah. Hello! Hello! Now, let me get this straight, Se?or Cintos. If I refuse to sign this paper, you will fire that gun. - Correct. - Yes... And at that distance you will probably kill me. Undoubtedly. Yes, well, in that case I'd better sign. Thank you. Don't mention it. - Carl, Henry! - What? It's Mr. de Lussac. Come with me quickly. What is it, Anna? Come, my friend. I'm going to count ten. - Uno, dos... - In Spanish? tres, quatro, cinco... Ah, ah, you skipped three. No... tres, quatro, cinco... Oh, yes, that's all right. seis... - Wait a minute. How will I know when you get to ten? You'll be dead. Ah... siete, ocho... - Sign! - I'm signing, I'm signing... but after I've signed, will you tell me what ten sounds in Spanish? Sign! Are you all right? Yes, and I owe you an apology, Anna. You were right. See the gentleman out, Henry. Que cobarde! Me pegas quando no estoy mirando, eh? That's right, Henry. Don't let him get to ten. - Anna. - Yes? Do you remember the first time you came to my rooms? The time I killed myself? Do you remember what I did? - You kissed me. - That's right. Something tells me I'm going to do it again. You really shouldn't. Why not? You've been just like a sister to me. Anna... you're angry. No. I was only thinking... that's the way I feel about Henry. - Henry? - Yes, the doorman. I suppose that's why I'm engaged to him. Eng... Oh, oh... I have ideas for Henry. He won't always be a doorman. Oh, no, no. Of course not. Well, here's to you and Henry. Thank you. - And a happy marriage. - Same to you. Oh, yes, yes, I'd almost forgotten. Three weeks from tomorrow. The same to me. Cigarette? Offering or asking? - Either or both. - In that case, no thank you. - You're very welcome. - Not at all. Suppose we resume our silence where we left off. Why not? There's where I first met that Cintos woman. Oh, yes, yes... No, it was there. - Let's not argue. - Perhaps I shouldn't have come. You better be good to her. - Who? - Susie. Oh, don't worry about Susie. Our lives stretch out before us like a concrete road. That's right, smooth, and clean and well-lighted. Yes, and a stop signal at every crossing. Why, you sound as though you weren't in love with Susie. Who is it? Mrs. Cintos? - You're an idiot. - No, no, now. Who? Mrs, Henry Doorman. You uncover more strange women. And overnight. When did Mrs. Dormouse materialize? - Doorman! - Oh. She hasn't quite. They're only engaged. Oh. Why was I such a failure with Susie? Your approach was wrong. You treated her with respect. Why, of course. Yes, that's the trouble. You treat respectable women one way and the other kind another. Reverse the procedure and see what happens. Your popularity will surprise you. Even with a girl like Susie? Please! Now you're speaking of my future wife. Then let me remind you the Flambergs are very prompt with dinner. - Hasn't it been fun? - The dinner was excellent. Tomorrow night we'll have it served in our room. Susie! - Well? - Mr. Piquard is in the library, sir. Oh, yes. The transfer of the nitrate concession. - Come along, Julian. You'll have to sign. - I know, when you count to ten. Oh, it'll take longer than that to go through all the papers. Two hours anyway. But we have theater tickets, haven't we, doodlebug? Yes, we have, dumpling. Well, Paul can take you to the theater. Oh, really? Of course, with pleasure. She'll be perfectly safe with Paul. Susie, did you hear what they said? - Safe. - Of course. That's what I like about you, Paul. You're so respectful. - Did you say respectful? - Why, yes. Aren't you? Well not exactly... that is to say, no, I'm not! - Oh, Paul! - Don't laugh, Susie. I might forget myself. What are you saying? Oh, I can't stand it! Susie Flamberg, take off those glasses! What? Take them off this instant! - If you don't, I'll... I'll... - You'll what? I'll be sorry. - Oh, what is it? - Oh, it's you, Susie. - You make me shiver. - Why? I shiver, shake and shiver just to be near you. I shiver and shake. You send the veins crossing through my blood. - Oh, Paul! - Respectful, am I? I'll show you. - Paul, go away. - I will not go away! - Paul! - You little siren! Paul! Paul. Yes? Have you a pin? Yes. Wait for me downstairs. Yes, Anna. - Susie! - Julian! I'm so sorry. But something terrible has happened. Paul and I... Well, I mean, that is... Come, dumpling. Anna! Anna doesn't work here anymore. Did uh... did you write this? - Yes. - Why? Because I'm catching a train early in the morning. - What time? - A quarter to six. A quarter to six. Let's shut the window! No, no, don't look! Are you really engaged to Henry? What do you think? Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
