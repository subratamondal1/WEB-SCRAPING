Here. Take it. - Oh, that's okay. - No, it's okay. It's free. There's no one here. They left it for us, so have some. - Thank you. - Tomorrow, I'll have to leave. I want to go and say goodbye to some of my family and friends, while there's still time. Would you like to come with me? - Oh, no. That's okay. - Will you try to get home? - Uh, no. No, I don't think so. I just, uh... I don't wanna waste whatever time I have left trying to get back to Portugal. There's no one there for me. - And your mom? - I... Um... She's not there. No. - And your father? - I, um... I've never met him, so... Uh, yeah. I don't have anyone, or anywhere to go. So I might as well just- - Well, you have me, and you can stay here. - Thank you, Ana. - It's a shame what has happened. I was hoping for more time. - Time for what? - Living. You know. Tears and laughter and... More food. Friends. You know. Just being alive. - Falling in love. - Oh, yes. That too. Absolutely. I think maybe there is time for one more great love. Dance with me. I, I don't dance and there's no music. - Oh, there's always music. You only have to listen. And everybody can dance. You know... When you're young, you have no cares in the world. And when you're old, you stop caring. And somewhere in the middle is the sort of life that we make for ourselves. I made a very good life for myself. And I will die knowing this. Paulo? Yeah? - Do you know why I stopped for you? - Um... Not really. - Because I saw you were alone. Do me a favor. - Of course. - If you see someone alone, go to them. No one should be alone in the end. - Do you think it will happen today? - I hope so. I just, you know, all the waiting. And nothing happening. It's kinda... Kinda feels like a cruel joke. Yeah. Wonder if it will be painful. - Let's not think about that. - I think it will be. And I think we kinda deserve it, so... So you're not from here? - No, my um, mother wanted to take this trip, yeah. - My mom is devastated but I can't really tell if she's devastated because I'm not there or if she's devastated because she's not gonna get to finish watching her shows. - You can tell her that, uh, they all die in the end. A bad joke. Sorry. - So at least you have your mom here. - Just me. - I'm sorry. I'm having a baby. - Thank you. - Wanna try? Yeah. - In Spain, when we start smoking, we say, something like,. "If my mother knew." And then, okay? How did you say in Portuguese? Wait. I'm not doing it right. How do you flick it? - That's pretty cool, but you are very bad at smoke. But don't worry, you still have beautiful lips. I have to tell you something, now that we are friends, okay? You should know that my heart, mi coraz√≥n or belongs to another, but I can make an exception for you, if you want. No, I come here trying to find him, because I don't want to die without love in my heart. - Did you? Yeah. Yeah, I find him. - What happened? - He didn't love me back. - Do you still love him? - Yeah. Yeah. - Then you'll still die with love in your heart. - Yeah, I think so. I don't... I'm not from here. I don't speak Icelandic. - Ah. That's okay. It's good, yeah. Yeah. - Strange. I didn't think it would be like this. - How did you imagine it? - Just like a... A big, a big party? With, you know, it's like the best News Years Eve. Everybody would be, you know, eating and drinking and dancing and laughing and just surrounded by love, you know? And, uh, then all of a sudden, boom. Everybody would be fucking and... It's great. - Yeah, I'm just glad I'm not home. - Mm? - I think I'd be much more angry if I was home. You know? - Angry how? - Just... All the lies and all the shit they did and, you know, it sounds bad to say this, but I feel like I... I'm kind of glad it's over. - Yeah. Yeah, me too, actually. I haven't done anything with my life. It's just... Been like a coward, really. You should be angry, you know. You should be angry. It's all fucking... Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. This fuckin', fucking beach. You should be angry! Huh? Do something. You should just do something. Do something! - I love the language, but I don't really understand what you're saying. - I love this weather. It soothes me. What do you think about what is happening? - I, uh... I'm not sure. You know how they say "in the end, you die alone?" I guess, now uh, dying together. I mean, that's like a little bit comforting. - You know, even in life, we are never really alone, though. Are we? We always have God. - What do you do if you're not a believer? If you don't believe in anything. Have you always felt this way? Not really but now it's becoming harder and harder with all that's happening, he did nothing to stop this. - Is that how you think he works? - I don't really know how he works. I don't pretend to. - You know, I've been sick and God has helped me. And people, even in death, need to find hope. Maybe God is that hope for them. It's sad that you gave up on God. - He gave up on me. - You shouldn't fear God if you're seeking something like salvation. - Salvation is not really what I'm seeking. - What is that you are seeking? - How to forgive. - I hope you find it in time. - I hope so, too. - Mias! Hello. - Hi. I'm, um, I'm Paulo. - Theodora. Thanks for letting me in. - He doesn't know, so please don't talk about it. Yeah? - She thinks I don't know. - Know what? - We're all dying. Are you scared? No. - I am. You're very smart. How do you play? - Paulo, Mias. Paulo,. Do you miss your home? I do, yeah. But I like it here, with you. Have you been other places? - No. No, not really. - Me too. - Look. These are old pictures of my home. You know, the people I see. And, uh, wait. Let me just, uh... And that's you. Oh, that is me? - Yeah. Do you wanna keep it? It's yours. You can keep the whole thing. Look. Thank you. You're welcome. - Mias. Are you ready for some cake? Yeah. - Okay, okay, okay. - So, where should I slice it? Here, here, here? He wants the whole cake. No. Yeah. Okay. Boom. - You're very good with him. Do you have any siblings? - Uh, no. No, it's just me and my mother. Where is his father? - He passed away when Mias was very young. - Does he remember him? - He knows he had a father who died, but he doesn't know how or when. - I didn't grow up with a father, either. My mother didn't talk about him that much. - I'm, I'm sure she had her reasons why. Sometimes, we mothers keep secrets away from our kids to protect them from the pain. Have you asked her? - I can't, anymore. Has Mias asked you? - That day will never come. - I think it's for his benefit to know something while he can. I know I would've liked to know anything, anything about my dad. - Yeah, then you should've asked. - I tried, but she never wanted to talk about him, so I stopped asking. Like you said, mothers keep secrets, but it's, it's not to protect their kids. It's to protect themselves. Scoop up. Scoop, scoop, scoop. Yeah. Yeah. - Mm-hm. - Read to me? I, I don't know how to read it. I don't know. What does this say? Cougar? What? You see, I don't know how to read it. I should probab- I should probably go, I think. No, stay. Mama, please. Please,. - Please stay, for Mias. And for me. Okay, okay. - Okay. - Okay? I'm gonna get ready for bed. - Tell me a story, Paulo. - But you have to close your eyes. Close your eyes. There was once this boy who used to sleep under the night sky. He... Would look up to the sky and dream about catching the stars. His favorite star was the brightest star in the sky. He would look up to this star to guide him. Every time he felt lost, the star would say, "This way, my son. Follow me." And he was the happiest boy ever. And then, one day, the star started to fade. And the star told him, "if you can't see me, listen for me. I'm still here to guide you. Listen for me." But then one day, the boy looked up to the sky and he couldn't see it, and he couldn't hear it. It was just gone. And, uh... He was very sad. And he just walked around with his head down. Lost and alone. He got so used to being sad that he forgot what being happy felt like. Then one day, he was walking around, and he tripped, and he fell. Face-down in the dirt. And... He just lied there for a very long time, until someone came and rolled him over. And there he was, looking up to the sky, and he saw it. Not only his star, but, all the stars. Shining down on him. "If only I looked up sooner," said the boy. She was... She was always sick, you know. When she didn't show up at the airport, I knew, I... And I kept telling myself, like, that's what she would have wanted, but... And then she was gone, and she was... It's okay. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I know. Let her go. Let her go. I'm sorry. I know. I know, I know, I know. - It's okay, it's okay. Just let her go. It's okay, it's okay. - Yeah. Please stay with me. Hey. - Hey. Hi. - Are you feeling better? - Uh... I'm sorry, what did you say? - The other night, you were sick on the road. - Right. Yeah, I was. - Feeling better? - Yeah. I am, thank you. Are you going to church? Church? No. No, it's too late for that. No, I'm going up that mountain. - Oh, right. - Paulo? I thought that was you. - Ana. - You made it back. - Yeah. We're still here. How have you been since I last saw you? - I'm okay. What? - Oh, you're okay. The world is ending and you're okay. I like that. I'm okay, you're okay. - We're all okay. - Are you ready? - I don't think I have a choice. - As long as we're here, we have a choice. At least, as of how we'll say our goodbyes. But I'm not worried. Death reunites us with those we love. - Do you really believe that? - Have to believe in something. Why not death? - Thank you. Talk about life here, but I definitely... - Hey. I don't, I don't... Can you speak Eng... I don't understand Icelandic. - We need take... - It's finally... It's finally happening, okay? You should be with your family now, okay? - Hi. Hello. - Have you heard the news? Yes. - I'm gonna climb to the top of that mountain. Do you wanna come with me? Yes. Yes, come in. I'm just gonna put on my shoes. Okay, ready. Where did you get this? - It's just something my mom made. - Your mother? - Yeah. - What's your name? - Paulo. Kristjansson. And you? - Kristjan. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
