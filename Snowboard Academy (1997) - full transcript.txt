Stick with the tour, please! Now, business has been a little slow, so in addition to p.R., you're gonna have to assume the responsibility of safety engineer.

I mean, it's not my fault my parents chose to vacation at the equator every year. Well, that's... That's ridiculous. No kidding. The equator, what kind of a destination is that? Do I look like a sun person? [Glass shattering] [Man on phone continues muttering] If you... no... Hey, slush, look. It's loafer boy. What made you crawl out from behind your desk? Dad told me to clean the trash off the hill. I just assumed he meant you, Christopher. Hey, watch it there, flamer. This here is thy wizard. Boss, permission to consificate these snowboards. A good idea, take 'em to the garage. We'll recycle them into firewood later. [Chuckling] You know, it's people like you who make me wish we could recycle white trash. And see how we can make the magical wizard and his little friends disappear before I charge them all with trespassing. Well, wait a second. What makes you could throw your weightlessness around here? Since pops made me general manager of the resort. Now I have the authority to have you and your punk friends locked up till the snow thaws.

I assumed it would be redundant to tell you not to injure the guests. Ya, uh, uh, what about this safety thing? All right, now, that's the lookout tower. You have to constantly be on the lookout for trouble. You know, like trespassing snowboarders. Well, i... I'm always on the lookout for trouble. You know, I mean not that I go around looking for trouble. I'm kind of like a troubleshooter. Not that I'm gonna go around shooting anybody. I mean, unless you want me to shoot snowboarders. What the hell was that? Ah, that's just some dynamite they set off on the difficult runs. Dynamite? Yeah. I guess that would make a run more difficult, huh? No, no. We just set it off to create a small avalanche, so we don't have big avalanches. So I should watch for avalanches. I'll... I'll keep my eyes open for them. I hope so. Ok. Let's recap.

Add 3 tablespoons margarine, one-quarter cup milk, and the cheese sauce mix. Stir well." Copy that. "If a thinner sauce is desired, add 2 tablespoons of milk." Not a problem. Red! Red! Come quickly! This better be important. Red! Red! Come quickly. A terrible crime's been committed. Come on. What's the problem? Red, man, it's terrible. You've gotta do something about this. What's going on? Somebody is stealing all the snow. Roger. Step aside. I'll check it out. [Door latching] Hey! So, red, I heard you got demoted. That's really too bad. That'll teach you not to harass the snowbunnies.

Dad, can snowboarding be considered a legitimate sport? Uh, loafer boy, it's in the Olympics. Yeah, so is shot put. Dad, look, snowboarding sales are through the roof right now, all right? If we don't take advantage of it, somebody else is gonna, and they're going to be raking in all the cash. Cash, what cash? Your friends are always ten cents short of a dime. Check, check, check.

[Laughing] Ok, nix on the sound check, right? Why did you hire this loser? Dad, check it out. I'm telling you, snowboarding's hot right now. It's in. We can start a whole new market. Forget it, dad. Snowboarders are a menace. They scare away the skiers. You remember the skiers, don't you? They're the paying customers. Boys, boys. I'm so tired, I can't hear myself think. Now, let's meet in my office, 6:00 sharp. We'll end this bickering once and for all. Hey, hey, Dennis? Whoa there, boys. I think maybe we've had enough, huh? Remember, alcohol never solved anything. All right, 6:00 sharp. (Mimi) It's just nice to play, you and I in the jacuzzi, nice and hot, and look at it being so miserably cold. Right? Ah, hello, husband. You seem surprised to find me here. [Chuckling] He's your husband? Oh, nothing gets by him, huh? Wait, let me guess. Chippendales had a scratch and dent sale? Well, let's just say that he speaks softly, but carries a big stick. And what about your love life, David? Still taking the hands on approach? You know, he's got the kind of face that you wouldn't get tired kicking. Well, if you're trying to intimidate him, he doesn't scare easily. Of course. You need a brain to register fear. Say, when's the last time you conditioned your hair? [Gasps] My hair? Well, thanks a lot. Now I have nobody to play with tonight. Thank you. Oh, look, Mimi, take a night off from being the resort's walking gland. Nobody will think the less of you for it. Especially if you sign these. Oh, still carrying around those damned divorce papers? What about the money you owe me? Money I owe you? For the time I put into this marriage, the pain and sacrifice. Oh, excuse me, rasputana, but as I recall, you left me the day after we were married. We only spent the first night together. Exactly, the pain and sacrifice. But I did come back, eh? Yeah, 10 years later, after I bought this ski hill. And then just to bleed me dry. Well, I am, how you say, an entrepreneur, darling. You are, how you say, a leech. So sue me. I'm trying to, you won't let me. Give it up, David, you've been trying to get rid of me since I got here. The day you got here, you didn't recognize me. You thought I was Arnold, the night manager. [Laughing] Honest mistake. He's Japanese. Stop it! You're not going to get rid of me until you can pay up. And with the way your son is running this place, it'll never happen. Now you sell this dump, I take half my money, give you divorce. Don't mess with me, or you'll wish you never set a foot on this mountain. I know a place where I'd like to set my foot. Hey, good evening... heh. Good evening, folks. Don't you hate following Danny devito? [Chuckling] Woman walks into a bar with a duck under her arm. The bartender says, "hey, whatcha doing with the pig?" She says, "I'll have you know, my good man, this is a duck." He says, "I was talking to the duck." [Chuckling] You suck! Thank you. Very witty! Hey, dances with the cows! (Rudy) everybody having a good time? Ahem. Great. Hey, anybody here from out of town? We're all from out of town. This is a resort. Yeah, right. [Sighs] Yes, Mimi, what is it now? Check. Check. Can you hear me back there? Check. You will bring me another double vodka. Hmm? Check. Check. You couldn't ask me when I was near the vodka? Check, check, check, check, check. Move on, and make it quick. Ok, I think we're about to complete the old sound check. Speaking of out of town, I just flew in from the coast and boy are my arms tired. I mean, what's with these airports? And what's with that jacket? Bulletproof, or what? Funny you should mention that. Our show's being brought to you tonight in portion by the bedazzler. Don't just make your clothes dazzle, make 'em bedazzle. If any of you would like to have some information on how to purchase your very own bedazzler, I'll be up at the bar. Now, I'm going to take a short break right now, but I'll be right back. No hurry. No shit! They're mean. Tough as a nickel steak. Interesting concept there, Rudy James, comedy, but without all that annoying laughter. Yeah, I been working on it for years. Boy, Mimi, she sure took a liking to you. Yeah, I noticed her boys were all bright and cheery. What do they exchange for Christmas, gifts or gunfire? No, they're not her boys. Ah, David adopted them long before she showed up. Yeah, I guess you could say the boss has a soft spot for hard-luck cases. Like me and you? Well, like you. Anyways, that's why he married the she-demon. And she just married the poor sap so she wouldn't get her ass dragged back to Russia. There once was a fat girl from Russia, who's butt was so wide it would crush ya... Hey, my mother's Russian. [Gasps] Sorry. It's ok. It's ok, I'll get it. Sorry. [Grunts] Break's over, get back up there. Hey. [Gasps] [Chattering] He's also in charge of resort safety. [Laughing] Now, that's funny. And this is good vodka. [Chuckling] (Rudy) Help! Somebody! Ok, Chris, I want you to act like an adult and convince me why we should allow snowboarding on our hill. Well, dad, if we take an analysis of the current market trend... Now, easy, take it... (Rudy) Help! C'mon, Chris, now stop making fun of your brother. All right, dad, look, snowboarding, all right? It's new, it's happening, it's hot, it's fresh, you know? It's the fastest-growing winter sport. We're going to allow snowboarding on certain parts of the hill. Yeah, dad. You rule! But only on one condition, Chris, and that is I want you to run the snowboarding school. And that includes setting up the pro shop and taking full responsibility. Now, what do you say? This is a major mistake. No, you're the mistake. Help! Help! Look, dad. Dad. I have major, major supply contacts, all right? This thing's gonna be a coin explosion! All right. Jessica, could you come in, please? Jessica, hi, how you doing? Well, since my opinions as general manager aren't necessary, I think I'll excuse myself! Please, Paul, sit down. Now, look, I know what your opinions are. Jessica, what do you think? We are going to allow snowboarding on certain parts of the hill. Well, seeing as how i'm the instructor at a ski school with hardly any students, I wouldn't want to talk my way out of a job by endorsing a 2nd school. But I gotta admit, snowboarding is really popular. All right. Chris, I'm gonna give you 2 weeks to prove yourself. You show me you can handle this thing, and you can continue. But if I hear one complaint from one of the skiers, then snowboarding's history on the hill. Paul, if I find out you're trying to coax a problem between the skiers and the snowboarders, I'm gonna demote you lower than red eagle one. Jessica, just to let you know, anybody'll tell you a snowboarder can, uh, kick a skier's ass anytime. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, that sounds like a declaration of war to me, buddy. Just make sure that your mouth can write checks that your butt can cash. Yo, girl, I will race you anytime. Tomorrow morning, 0800 hours, on the widow-maker. It's a date. [Panting] Excuse me, quick question, suppose someone should, oh, I don't know, set themselves on fire? Where would the medicine be? Wow! Amazing! You know, if you stare into the sun long enough, you can go completely blind! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! [All cheering] Awesome. Whoo! Hah! Whoo! [Sighs] Let me guess, lizard, you let me win, right? Oh, you're damn straight I let you win. Although, the view was very nice from back there. And now, your butt can cash my checks anytime. Too bad, Chris, I kinda like the idea of you winning in a parallel universe. Hey, I like parallel parking. You know, where they put all the little cars in there diagonally and... Rudy, I didn't hire you to act like a clown. I... Well, actually, I did, didn't I? Well, look, just, uh, make yourself useful, all right? Go get some new clothes and pick up your skis at the pro shop. Skis! All-righty, Rudy, be right back. Well, Mr. Barry, I guess I was wrong. Looks like my ski school won't have much competition after all, huh? A competition, that's it. A competition to see whether snowboarding should be allowed on this hill. Your point being? We have a contest at the end of probation. Skiers versus boarders. If the boarders lose, no more snowboarding. What the hell's that gonna prove? Yeah, you're being a touch vindictive, aren't you? That's very vindictive, pop! It's simple. I'm the general manager. It's my job to make sure things run smoothly around here. If Chris wants to win, he's gonna have to work his ass off, not goof off. Let's just say it's my way to make sure he stays in line. Well, wiz, what do you say? You up for it? On one condition. What? Part of the competition is a rematch between the Betty and myself. Oh, a glutton for punishment, huh? I accept. [Chuckling] No, sweets, if we race again, we're gonna race extreme. [Cash register beeping] [People chattering] [Bell ringing] [Door opening] Hi, can I help you? Oh, aren't you our new safety guy/human torch? Safety engineer, Rudy James, and you are? I'm Tori. I run the pro shops and the daycare. Please don't burn either one down. Wow, they really take this 2 hat thing seriously, huh? Um, I'm supposed to get some skis. What size? I'm not sure, really. Whatever size will keep me on my feet, bottom heavy, gravity proof, nice and thick, none of those thin ones. Let me put it this way, I don't want my ass to touch the snow, ok? I'm sure the snow feels the same way. How about I just attach toboggans to your feet? I think now we're getting somewhere. Good. [Laughs] Hey! Excuse me! Oh! Uh! [Laughing] It's ok. Most people like to put their skis on outside. Yes, but I wanted to test them before I get out on a dangerous slick substance, like snow. Safety first, you know. Right. Ok, just, uh, let me turn around here. Turning, I think, is kind of the hard part, isn't it? Yeah. (Man on P.A.) Tori to the daycare. Tori to the daycare. Oh! Go ahead, don't mind me. I'm probably going to regret this, but help yourself. [Grunting] Perfect. Ok. Good. Very good. I better straighten the place up a little. [All chattering] This isn't so hard. I've got my balance.

How am I supposed to get down? Bootsy, George Clinton, or hey, my fave, James brown. Very funny. I thought so. Let's take the blue slope. Hey, guys, wait up! This couldn't be too hard. That's it. They... they've goofed. They... they're off of the hill. Would you chill out, man? They're completely harmless. They're making a mockery of this place and you're encouraging them! I mean, look at this tent and this... this halfpipe pothole. On my hill. Oh, oh, on your hill? Yippee! Oh, yeah! Yee-haw! Banzai! Lift. Turn. Lift, turn. [Panting] Help. I've fallen and I can't get up. [Beatboxing] It's our first customer. Sonjai! All right. You're here. How do you feel? Oh, uh, bitching surf, dude. I'm totally stoked on a powder. [Laughs] Very good, huh? All right! All right! Very good! Totally great. All right, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. All right! Oh, yeah, that hurts. [People chattering] (Woman) Uh, sometimes. Actually, don't get me a Tequila. I'm off that now. I think i'm gonna go out on a renossocance mission. You mean reconnaissance. That's exactly what I mean. Good. Right. Ok, could I have your attention, please? Attention! Now, this is my way of saying thanks to each and every one of you. 'Cause I know it hasn't been easy lately, what with everybody having to do 2 jobs and all. Well, not everybody. Bastard. And I'd also like to say how proud I am of my son Chris. Now, he and his friends have earned US a sizeable sum of money with their snowboarding sales and lessons. Well done, son. [All cheering] (Girl) Snowboards! (Boy) Yeah! Of course, none of this would be possible without the firm management of my older son Paul. We've generated more revenue than any of the other hills in the area, in spite of erratic weather. Whoo. But a deal's a deal. And if the snowboard academy doesn't win the upcoming contest, well, it's over. So I want to see everyone out there in a big show of support. [All cheering] All right, now I want you all to have a drink on me, and let our good friend Rudy James entertain you. Rudy! Where the hell is he, anyway? Hello? Hello? [Gasping] Well, it's not so bad. Maybe a... maybe a skier will come by in the morning and find me here. I'll be ok. I'm not freezing or anything. Oh! Oh, god! Help! Oh, no! Help me! Oh, help! Help! Help! Oh, god! Please, anybody! Help me! Mimi, my dear, this is your last chance. Tsk, tsk, tsk. No, no. This is my last chance on fire. Any questions? You are making a big mistake. You think I'll leave my investment when it's finally getting profitable? What kind of gold digger do you think I really am? I'd rather be sleeping with the first guy walking through that door, than signing those bloody papers. I'm sorry I'm late, boss. Did I miss anything? [Chuckling] If you have any 2nd thoughts, let me know. Piss off. Screw you. You idiot. You're supposed to be nonchalant. Hey, nobody calls me "chalant." Shut up and sit down. Bastard David. Don't you worry about David, sweetheart, because here comes Goliath. Mmm. [Chuckles] Check. [Grunts] Party at the boarding school.

We were, uh, just talking about you. Oh, there you are, Paul. I've been looking all over for you. Yes, what can I do for you today, sir? Well, listen, I've got an insurance inspector coming over tomorrow... No, you listen, dad. Why Chris? After all this time. I mean, he's so irresponsible. Is that what this is all about? Look, it's the first time he's shown any initiative... Then why don't you ask your prodigal son Chris to take care of your insurance problems? What the hell did I do? Why is he so upset? Sorry, I can't tell you that. Telling you would violate the client-bartender privilege. Ah, who cares, really? It's like this. [People chattering] [Chattering] (Girl) Check out that board, man. (Girl #2) Wow! [All talking] He was a character. Save the whales. Hey, save the whales. Come on. You, save the whales? Anybody? You? Hey, freak, you wake up. Save the whales? Morning, Mr. Barry. I'm Paul Stanley, with your insurance company. Well, I've been expecting you. What do you say we get this thing over with and then spend a wonderful day at the races? Sound good? [Clock ticking] Save the whales. Good luck, sonjai. You're gonna need it. Piece of cake. Yo, uh, slush-puppy-San! What up, bro-fie? You want some? Uh, no, thank you very much. Uh, check it out, man. That is olympic skier I have to race against. Yeah, whoa! Correcto, poppa-bro. Uh, but I only learned how to snowboard last week. No fret, cadet. She's an uptight skier. And you are a click and skate can-do beastie man. Yes, but I don't... You gotta think. Think gnarly. Think wind in the face. Think tasty babes rubbing the belly of the sandman as you hold that victory cup up to the heavens. But this race is bogally totus. It's no fair! Right on, dude. No fear. No. No fair! Right on, dude. No fear. You just gotta pull a rolly, Wally, little fakey and half-pike right down through the Mexico bordo. You know what I'm saying? Not really, no. You gotta chillax, man. You gotta do it, bro. You can do it. Oh, all right. I'll give it a try. [Chattering] So, how long you been in the insurance racket? [Laughs] Uh, do you know a frank b... [chair lift whirring] Oh, well, um, don't worry. This is just temporary. They're probably conducting tests on the lift system. Um, no... no problem. [Sighs] [Choking] [Sighs] [Spits] Oh! [Coughing] (Man) This should be good. This should be really good. [All chattering] On your marks. [Sneezes] [All cheering] [Crowd cheering] Check out the sonjai, man! Yeah! And now, with a breathtaking finish, the winner of our first event is Lucy laroche. [Panting] [People booing] What was that? ♪ [Humming] You all right? [Grunts] We have been sabotaged. And whoever did this must pay severely. Well, did you see who it was? No. We have another chance in the freestyle event. Are you ready? [Whimpers] [Chair lift screeches] What kind of test takes so long? Next up is the freestyle event. And in the starting position for the skier's competition is world cup champion John Ross. [People chattering] You might as well crib it, biscuit-head, as I bust this cherry-cherry, pow-pow. Rattles me not, knuckle-dragger. I'm wrapping up full and misty 540. Cha! Oh, man. Whew! [Crowd cheering] [Cheering] [All hooting] [Machine whirring] Whoo! Hey! What are you trying to do, blind him? You almost blinded me! Slush, you all right? Hey, dude-bro. Yeah, man. Where you been, man? Time to board. You're the man, the main slushster! It's looking sketchy, dude. Yeah, it is. [Gun firing] There's the gun. Come on. Go, slush, go! Go, baby! Whoo! [All chattering] Let me guess. Another test? (Slush) I can't see, man! Out of the way! [All exclaiming] Whoo-hoo! [Hooting] Hey, man! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yes! Yes! [All whooping] Oh, yeah! Did you... ♪ [humming la marseillaise] What's up? Paul. Go call Chris. [Mr. Barry laughs] Well, we're moving again. Listen, I gotta be straight with you. I still have to see your lookout tower and speak to your safety engineer, but I gotta be honest, it doesn't look too good. Our safety engineer? No, well, he's... he's occupied with the race right now. So you... Any questions you have to ask him, you can ask me. If you don't mind, I'll interview the gentleman myself. God. Hey, pal, this is a restricted area. I'm the insurance inspector. Oh, well, here, uh... Come on in, sit down. Have a seat. Make yourself at home. It's all right. So tell me, what's your average response to a distress call? Uh, on average, our average response time is about average. [Motor humming] [Door opening] Freeze, man, we've got ya. Man, has your brother always been such a sore loser? What? You guys still stewed about the professional skier thing? Relax. You won the last race, right? All right, what's going on in here? Hey, pop. Well, big bro here, he tried to sabotage the race. What? Oh, did I stutter? What are you doing in here, anyways, huh? I'm turning on the chair lift and turning off the snowmakers. Somebody's got to take care of things around here while the rest of the staff is slacking off. You mean somebody has to screw things up while the staff is preoccupied. Yes, where were you during the first contest? Why you hit me with a large snowball? Yeah, and you spewed pseudo-powder all over me and my deck, bro. Where were you during bastille day? Why is room service so horrible? Son, of all the days to pick to get even with your brother, why pick today? That chip on your shoulder's gonna cost me my insurance. Dad, not you, too. I don't believe this! Well, didn't you tell Dennis, "Mark my words, tomorrow, they're gonna suffer a humiliating defeat?" I was drunk. Besides, I was talking about those olympic skiers. You guys think I'm a poor loser. You should look at you people. Wait a sec. Who wants to see US lose more than you? Ok, pal, why don't you and I race, instead of Jessica? May I have a rain check? Sure. You're on. All right, look. Forget it. It doesn't matter anymore. My insurance is being revoked as we speak. Dad, it's not my fault. I would never jeopardize the ski hill. [Sighs] You believe these idiots. Why don't you believe me, me, me? Mimi? Mimi! Mimi. (All) Mimi! Of course. Son, I'm sorry. Look, please forgive me. Me, too. I still say you're a punk. There's one race left. You're on. [All chattering] Well, how much first-aid training have you received? Do you have a first-aid certificate? Certificate. Certificate, certificate. Oh, look! There's someone on trail number 9. My god, you're right! I am? Oh, no. You got pretty keen eyesight there, buddy. I've gotta go save that young maiden. It's my duty. [Door opening] Well, here, hey, you're gonna need your snowboard. I suppose running would be out of the question, huh? Well, unless you've got skis. [Chain saw whirring] I've got to at least try to save that girl. I'm the only chance she's got. Her life is hanging by a thread. I have nothing but confidence in myself. And very little of that. [Screaming] [Grunts] Ha! Hey, you better get your hands off of me, punk, or I'll have to use some of my green beret tactics on you. [Grunts] Hey! Hey, watch that! Hey! I'm telling you, I'm gonna use now tactic number 67 and you'll be in deep water, boy! [Yelling] (Rudy) Get out of the way! [Rudy screaming] [Beeping] (Rudy) A bomb! This is a warhead! [Screaming] [Yelling] What was that? [Screaming] Paul, you all right, bro? Yeah. You? I'm fine. Who was that? Rudy James. [Both panting] Hey, Paul, let's call this race a draw? Deal. Deal. Let's go find out what's up. Boys! Look, what happened up there? Rudy James. Rudy James exploded? Uh, no, he risked his life for US. We've gotta go find him. Pop, he's on trail 9. I don't know how bad he is. You gotta get him. All right. Slush, gordo. Get him, gordo. I-I-It's not my fault. I didn't know you wanted her to set off an avalanche. Please don't fire me, Mr. Barry. Please. Easy, boy. Easy. Inspector, don't do anything just yet. We have evidence to prove this is sabotage. Don't bother. Oh, wait a minute, we have proof. I know. I know. I saw evidence of the sabotage myself. Don't worry, I'm gonna insure you. Especially if you keep this brave man on your payroll. Rudy James? He knows no fear. You're lucky to have a loyal man like him working for you. I also entertain. I wear 2 hats. You know, this whole situation reminds me of a story I heard. Ok, there are two guys walking into a chalet, skiers, a German and a frenchman, and the frenchman turns to the German and he says... (All) Wear a necktie. Uh, excuse me, there's no snow in here. Miss, there's no snow in here. Huh? Huh? You bitch! [Grunts] [Whimpering] [Grunts] Now you're really pissing me off! [Moans] She's all yours, boys. Yep, that's her, all right. David, I want you to fire this woman right now. Spare me, moomoo. We got you this time. Meet the insurance inspector that saw everything. Yes, ma'am, I saw you with the dynamite. What I'd like to know is, why? Allow me. See, if I had lost the insurance, then I would have been forced to sell this place and she would've taken half the money. (Both) Oh! Fiendish. I thought I'd seen everything. [Siren wails] Well, Mimi, the way I look at it, what with the lawsuit and the criminal charges and the property damage and the punitive damages... Fine, fine, fine. I'll sign those damn divorce papers. But you promise you won't sue. Just sign the papers. There. Now tell him to remove these cuffs. Well, do something, David. I'll do "zumzing." But only because I'm a gentleman. David! Don't you worry, Mimi, I've got a plan. Tactical number 947. Uh, excuse me. Are you Mr. Barry? Who wants to know? I'm Mr. Greenwald. I'm with the n.S.C., national sports channel. I just had to tell you that this was one hell of a show. Very fresh! I mean, this skiing versus snowboarding could be the biggest thing to happen in winter sports since ice fishing. We could attract a whole new audience with this. Well, I think you should talk to my son, Paul. He came up with the idea in the first place. Mmm, Paul. Why don't we talk about this over some beers, boys? Drinks are on the house! Yeah! (Mimi) What about me? David, honey, you know I love you. Oh, and I love you, too, my dear. Bye, Mimi. Bastard. Could you hold that, please? Thank you. Hey! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Stop! Stop, or I will hurt you. It won't be pretty. [Siren wailing] Mimi, I'll get you back! Hey! What's going on? Stop this vehicle immediately! Hey! Help! Yeah, let's go. [All chattering] Oh, Chris, Chris, Chris. How about some boarding lessons? Very cool, you got that. How about a proper introduction to my posse? Very cool. Hey, it's the t.V. Guy. Hey! Hey! Here we go. Ok, this calls for a celebration. Hey, I've got an idea. How about hot-tub cannonball diving? [All groaning] Head for the hills! (Girl) Wicked! [Cheering] Hey, be careful! It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye. But, hey, when someone loses an eye around here, the party's just beginning. ♪ Altitude ♪ ♪ down range 1400 miles now ♪ ♪ Altitude 102.8 nautical miles ♪ ♪ Velocity ♪ ♪ we're leavin' this planet we're on our way ♪ ♪ you know, the world has got nothin' else to say ♪ ♪ we like to fly you can keep that car ♪ ♪ we'll make a plan to get really far today ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ girl, lonely is an architect ♪ ♪ but the neihbor never knew ♪ ♪ he drives a little yellow pickup truck ♪ ♪ that used to be blue ♪ ♪ velocity ♪ ♪ altitude ♪ ♪ we're out there now and it's really kind of nice ♪ ♪ we even seen a few galactic meteorites ♪ ♪ a few more days and then we land ♪ ♪ you know, we're glad we left because we can't stand it ♪ ♪ oh, yeah ♪ ♪ today ♪ ♪ Velocity ♪ [All hooting] [All cheering] ♪ We're leaving this planet ♪ ♪ we're leaving this planet ♪ ♪ we're leaving this planet ♪ ♪ we're leaving this planet ♪ ♪ walk on ♪ ♪ T-minus 20 seconds and counting ♪ ♪ 15, 14, 13, 12 ♪ ♪ 11, 10, 9 ♪ ♪ 4, 3 ♪ ♪ 2, 1 ♪
