How do you sleep so well? Finish it! I can not do it. It is neurological. Shut the fuck up! Sugli Champs-Elysees With the sun or rain at noon or midnight Find whatever you want on the Champs-Elysées Can I take a picture? Champs-Elysees! Do you want the gilettino? I'm gassed! Loïc, I'm fucking hot! Good morning! - Did you get my message? - Which? The one at 5:42, 5:46 or 5:48? Or maybe the one at 6:29? 34 messages in an hour is your record, I guess. - I need to talk. - Speak? This is not talking. "Monster", "bitch", "bitch"... It must be Tourette's syndrome. No, I thought too much, one idea leads to another and then with the messages you can not stop. - Hello Mom. - Hello. - Coffee? - No, just a piece of bread. You fell out of bed. I had soccer, but I didn't wake up. But... it's almost time for lunch. - Let's have brunch, right? - I have to go to the demonstration later. - No brunch for me. - At the demonstration? - What are you going to do? - Manifesto. - There isn't a concert. - I know it. Are you becoming a black bloc? Last year you were thrilled that he was skipping school for demonstrations. This is a far-right protest. - Here he generalizes! Ignore it. - Indeed. Be careful and call to say where you are, I always want to know. It's me? Julie... don't you want us to make peace? We can't keep our nose like this forever. It's crazy how you don't listen. I'm going to stay in another house. - Thing? - I'm going away. Because? We fought other times as well. Yesterday you threw up awful things on me for hours and hours. And today I wake up with what? - I can not stand you. - Do you think there is nothing to save between us? We are here! But that's crazy! Even if Macron doesn't want us, we are there! He's really badass! For the honor of the workers and for a better world. Even if Macron doesn't want us, we are there! Macron, resign! Macron, resign! Are you okay, guys? It's all OK? Have you been here long? Aren't you tired of being insulted? Don't have enough? Take off your helmet and come with us. Join us! Join us, guys! We are all the same here. Backwards! - I smoke a cigarette. - Don't be an idiot. I'm just talking. Robocop, I bet there's a beating heart under there. We all have a heart. Doesn't your grandmother live on 700 euros a month? What's up First warning! - How many warnings are you giving me? - According to! - How many? - Third! I did nothing! Hey friend! Julie! You forgot the bottle. Look how you put on your scarf. Too tight and does not cover anything. No. I feel like walking, can I accompany you for a while? We said I'm going alone. Said this... Bénédicte has invited us both, she will be disappointed if... Okay, go there, but without me! Lady, open your eyes, look at me. Lady... Recover, look at me. Open your eyes. Here, I'm here. Is fine? Let's take a wheelchair. Wait! Do not move. - The health card? - Calm. My colleague has it for acceptance. I need to call my friend. She's on her way, called her from the ambulance. Don't worry, it's on its way. Arriva. Knows where. Do not worry. You were right, they put me in the middle, I'm in the hospital. Call me, we'll talk later. Fuck. Ciao. What are you doing here? Didn't you work yesterday? Yesterday, the day before yesterday, is the sixth night in a row. It is madness. I could not refuse, I could not abandon you. You can't go on like this. How are you? Jalil continues to complain, the child is sick... Full package. What happened? A grenade, I think. Has he fainted? I felt very hot, I didn't understand anything anymore. - How long was he passed out? - I have no idea. - Is it serious? - It is not to be underestimated. Orange means they will visit it soon. Is there also a certain Loïc Triboit? I lost it at the demonstration. I have no way of knowing. - The lady was kind. - The one that brought her here? Yup. I'll put the bracelet on you, it's one of the priority cases. How does she feel? My head hurts so much. It hurts so much. Did you beat her? I do not believe. - I feel like throwing up. - It's the pain. Now I'll give you something. - Can Tramadol go? - Yes, I like everything. - Allergies? - No, go hard. - The address is right? - Yes, it's my mother's in Nîmes. - I need an emergency contact. - My mother. - But don't call her, she doesn't know anything yet. - All right. It's only for his briefcase, in case he can't express himself anymore. Ecco. Open your hand. Do you think it's broken? I can't know without an x-ray. - They'll send her home soon. - I'm scared. I'm afraid of something else. - About what? - To die alone. Hand! Why never? - Is the leg okay? - Yup. - Molard? - A broken tooth and a split lip. He has been visited, he can leave as soon as possible. Stojanovic? It arrived in very bad condition, the hand was ripped off. Intravenous morphine in the left arm. Two doses of 2mg and 3mg 5 minutes ago. He'll need more soon, he's in pain. - Have you seen Orthopedics yet? - I do not know. Cheng, diabetic ketoacidosis. - The patient from last week? - The candy devourer. Exactly. We ran the tests, he's on insulin. Rivoire, head trauma, we are waiting for the RM. - Anti-coagulanti? - No. Bakayoko, suspected pulmonary embolism. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, he's on oxygen. No special instructions for the moment. - Good work. - Thank you. Worse than last Saturday, I guess. We have real war wounds. The orthopedist has been in the operating room for hours. - I heard orthopedics. OK. - Okay, we can operate. I forgot: we have orders to provide the details of the hospitalized yellow vests. - Who asked? - Surveillance, that's all I know. - And then they communicate them to the Prefecture? - I do not know. - I don't. - Don't do it, others will. We told you, you do what you think is right. - Good work. - I've already decided. Thanks good night. - Leave me! - He can't sleep here. I am looking for Loïc Triboit, we were at the demonstration. - Is he a relative? - No, a colleague. - I'm sorry, I can't tell you. - So how do I find it? - Please go back to the waiting room. - Just take a look at the computer. Next, please. Holy shit! It is madness. No? - Miss? - I arrive. - Excuse me, can you turn up the volume? - I can not. Lady. - Macron is talking, I'd like to hear. - I said no. - He won't want us to hear Macron! - Don't you care? We already know: it is doing what the country needs. Pronto? I can't speak, Jal, I've just started my shift. Did you give her some acetaminophen? Wait a bit, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Don't panic, we'll talk later. How are you Madam? She's cold? Do you want a sheet? - I do not know. - He does not know? Where do you live? Who. Where are we here? - We're in the hospital. - No it is not true. Yes, she passed out. Do you remember what happened? No. Fell. The firefighters brought her here. Now I'll put the drip on her. Do you want me to notify someone? Yes who? - I do not know. - All right. Notify the doctor and come back later. Quiet... so. Calm down, inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The mask must not be removed. Don't touch it. - How are you? - Fine you? Good. Do you know they want us to give the names of the demonstrators? Yup. We should go around the ward to make sure no one does. - Agree. - Do you take care of it? Here you are! So? - My love. - What happened? I ran after you and slipped. You're pale, I've never seen you like this. I ruined your evening, forgive me. Forget about it! I've been on the phone for an hour, I haven't heard from Eliott. Don't worry, he's not a fool. Did a doctor see you? What did they say? I don't know, but I have a red bracelet. - What does red mean? - Which is pretty serious. Signor Perrier? Do you want to see? Are you sure? It's awful! It looks like a knee. - A knee instead of the elbow. - It's also great. Don't look at it. I will not be able to work, I will not be able to draw. Wait to speak to the doctor. I'm afraid they'll hold me back. Usually, they discharge immediately. - How many months does it take, if it's broken? - I don't know, a couple. Wait up. Because... I will be alone, I will not be able to draw and I have a ton of work. - Don't panic. - It is not possible! We'll find a solution. You can take a nurse home, a cleaning lady. - A nurse? - Yup. As if you were my grandmother? Excuse me! I was wrong to call you, I can't take pity on you. - That's my limit. - Now don't start. - You're kind only because you pity me. - No, you piss me off. Did they give you a painkiller? What did they give you? Only paracetamol. - That's all? - It didn't help. Don't you have anything stronger? It hurts. - No, the foot is not injured. - The vibrations. Please don't be dramatic. It hurts me dog! It hurts! An expired Subutex is not a good idea. - Do you still take it? - No, it's been in the bag for years. - Why do you have it? - Don't break, it's expired. Don't take anything in case they need to operate on you. Give me that. - No! - Please, it hurts me. Nurse, excuse me? - Can you give her anything? - You must have a little patience. When will you see the doctor? Did you get it? Are you crazy! What the fuck! You are crazy! Here, he must not be swallowed, he must be melted under the tongue. I'll get you some water. Fucking machine! He ate my money. Fuck! - Everything is fine? - Yup. Fucking machine! There is only shit in there! It's a hospital, there's only crap to eat! But is this normal? - You wanna eat that shit? - No. It makes you bad. We may be poor, but they can't make us eat this shit. - I have some change... - Did I ask you for alms? - No. - Then that's enough. He ate my money! Nurse, I've been waiting for an hour. There is something that stinks. - I'm the one who stinks. - No. It's vomit. Did you puke? - No. - Smells like vomit. - It wasn't me. - Smell. Disgusting, but it wasn't me. You must have slipped into the vomit. - No! - Yup! I'll go clean it for you. - Wait up. - You're kind. Thank you, love, you are my love. - Raf... - You are my love. I'm here because you're hurt, but nothing changes. We are separating. - Lady, are you all right? - Shit! Let me fuck you piss! Let me piss, bitch! Bitch! What balls! - The skirt. - Don't break! Pronto? Still nothing. There's the answering machine, I'm going crazy. I know, I've seen. Do you want me to call his friends and then you call the police? They will tell you, why shouldn't they? Lady? - Lady. - Yup? I'm going to throw up. Now I'm looking for someone. Is there anyone? Ecco. Sorry, I'm lost, it's a maze. Are you OK? You look stoned. You have spiked pupils. You see? I can't do it with this hand. - I can't finish in time. - It's not that bad. That's no good. It's not good at all. - It 'does not matter. - I tried... "It's okay"? You will finish later. Then it doesn't matter. - What can I say? - What's he got? I do not know. - Don't point, it's embarrassing. - He's sick. It just is! Do you have a psychotic crisis? I do not know. I'm so sorry to see all these people here. Don't you want to try to sleep? - You went. - Where's my coat? - I threw it out. - Did you throw it out? My Agnès B coat? It smelled like vomit, it sucked. - Just take it to the dry cleaners. - Yes, well... You can't decide to throw away my Agnès B coat! You'll buy yourself another one. Who cares! - Go get it back. - It made you look old anyway. Why didn't you ever tell me? Tell me if something doesn't suit me. What are you doing? I'm stressed too. I'm stressed too. Okay, I understand. It's my fault, okay. "I, I, I"... it's not just you, I'm worried about Eliott. I told you not to let him go. I say things, then... For once you agree with Valérie, be happy. He wants me to call the police. Thing? Valérie wants me to call the police. Valérie is a breakdown. - What do you call her. - You know she can't. Always pissing us off! They won't be asking her if she's the biological mother. You know he has no right, it's humiliating. - Stop it, don't start over! - You always defend her. Valerie... Why is that guy staring at us? Keep staring. Do you know him? Stop that. Stop looking at it, please. - Who is? - I do not know... - Stop looking at it. - Who is she? - A friend from high school. - Is he your age? - Life has been hardly kind to him. - How contemptuous you are! Go talk. What's your name? It is part of the past. He is called Laurent Maillard. I say hello. Stop it or I'll go. Did you go to bed? - You did it. - He was just a friend. - That's enough. - Was he the first? It's an old story, okay? How many before him? - Tell me. - You are crazy. Third fourth? Come on! Does he have a big cock? Ladies Raphaëlle Catania! Yup. It's me, not her, it's me. Excuse me. - Do not move. - I can walk, nurse. My mother is old... Excuse me? My leg is bleeding. It will soon be her turn. They shot me! Don't I have right of way? Lord, lower your voice, please. Did they shoot you? - We don't have enough staff. - Then manifest with us. We've been on strike for months, but who cares if we stop working? Have you heard? Do what it can! Did I ask you? Shut your mouth! Who told you to call me you? Thing? Big. - What does that bourgeois want from me? - How dare you? They broke, the yellow vests. Leave us alone! He can not come. I wait here? I want to stay with her. I lose blood, I will lose my house, my job... I'm losing everything! Fuck! Do you have free beds? Here we are full. Where do I find ketamine? We don't have any more. - Get some at the pharmacy. - Can you go? I have to do it. I still have three withdrawals to make. As usual, don't help me. Bakayoko continues to take off the mask. I just saw it. - They're coming to get him for the RM. - Then they have a place in cardiology? I await the answer. Follow the recipe. Stop at the check-in on the left. Eliott, call Mom right away. She is worried. Please. Pets are not allowed! Can't you do a gastric lavage on him too? Why save me and not him? This is a hospital, not a veterinary clinic. Don't drag him like that! A dog in a hospital! What's wrong with them? Milo, can you call me? I would like to know where you are, okay? Or tell Eliott to call me. Julie? Laurent... Laurent Maillard del liceo. It's crazy. Do you live in Paris? No, anchor to Valenciennes. We came for the demonstration, the police beat Elodie. Shit, is it serious? - No, I'll be fine. - If you say so. They beat her up, though. Do you want to sit down? No, I'm waiting for news of my son, he was also at the demonstration. I understand. Bad situation. - How many children? - I have one. - Do you have children? - We're not together. We met at a sit-in at a roundabout. Sorry. Well, good luck. I haven't eaten since this morning, do you know where I can get a snack? No, we do surprise Ramadan here. You don't eat, it's Ramadan. Leave it there, we are not ready. So, did they visit it? - Leave me alone, okay? - Still in a bad mood? We are all sick or injured here. There is no reason why it should be prioritized. He is not a martyr. I am not a martyr, but do you think it is normal for them to be shot at us? No. This does not give her the right to be hateful and violent. Stop it now. Who is violent? Chi? Get out of your bubble! Maybe she doesn't have reason to be pissed off either. You don't have to struggle to make ends meet. People like me don't live, they survive. Obviously she doesn't understand, it's none of her business, she has it all, she doesn't need anything. Are you giving me a lecture why you voted for Macron? Wait a minute, who said I voted for Macron? Look me in the eye. Didn't you vote for Macron? Did he vote right? Leave me alone, I didn't ask you who you voted for. Come on, ask me who I voted for. Did you vote for the blonde? A proletarian votes for Le Pen, is that right? And is abstaining the same as voting for her? He would do anything to avoid the truth. Le Pen is there because of you, not our fault. It's true! - In 2002... - What does 2002 have to do with it? - In 2002 I demonstrated, when Le Pen... - Of course and no one has heard of it since! I was in La Baule and an hour later I was in Bastille. He doesn't even remember which ideal he voted for, it's pathetic! Frankly, at his age... - At my age? - She forgot what he fights for. What does my age have to do with it? What does my age have to do with it? Excuse me, I did not understand! What does my age have to do with it? Do you know what I do at my age? I'm sending you to fuck off, okay? I'm sending you to fuck off, direct. Reprimand me for my age! - He hurt me terribly! - What's going on here? - He hurt my hand! - Just scream. Do you feel better? Go ahead. - I thought I was... - Wait. - I thought I was an urgent case. - I, I, I... Don't make things worse, calm down. His bracelet is orange. You dropped me here like a package! But it's surreal! It hurts! Julie! Julie, it hurts me! Julie, where are you? - Calm down. - I'm calm. This is neither the place nor the time. All right, I sleep. Stop, stop! I have to get to the knee, his jeans are still ruined. They can last a while longer. Believe? It is the leg that is important, not the jeans. Ecco. It's a bit sticky. - Things? - Sterile water. The blindfold is... stuck to the wound. - Do you want painkillers? - No. I have to drive the truck 700 km. - Have you seen his leg? - No. We unpack it, so he sees it. In short... I'm almost done, sorry. We are almost there. - Fuck! - He Stay still, I have not put the banks. And now? Is she deep? Fuck! I won't hide it from her, she's pretty bad. - If you don't want medicine... - I don't want to! Can I suggest an alternative? - A herbal tea? - A gas. A gas. A gas? Shit, look there! - I'm trying to help you. - I know, I'm sorry. Notice the doctor. What's wrong with that? - I'm going to find Julie for her. - Wait... - Nurse! - Lady? Lady? - Where is he going? - My head is spinning. Exactly, it is better that he lay down. - Lady! - Julie? Lady, Julie is not there. Keep your legs straight, step by step. Lie down. Here, now you leave me. - Excuse me. - It's all OK. - Excuse me. - Do not worry. Excuse me. - Is that okay? - Very good. What's wrong, lady? Keep calm. Did you undress her? Bene. Don't cover it up too much. No, wait a little longer. Exactly. No, Jal, I'm at work, I can't. Yes, I know. How are you doing? No. Do you have any news? Are you in custody? How long will they keep it? No, I haven't seen a doctor yet. No, I'm fine. I've been a while... Is anyone called Julie? - Is there a Julie here? - Yes I am. I have to go. What happen? Can you take care of your friend? We can't calm her down. I'm sorry. - Kim, Kim... - Calmati. - Are you there tonight? - Yup. - Good. Kim is a sister to me. - But I can't help you now. I see pictures and the pink chairs are dangerous. Here is a quiet corner. Sit down here and I'll be back as soon as I can. Sit down and breathe calmly. I'll be back as soon as I can. All right? Excuse me. Shouldn't he be in psychiatry? With the psychiatric wards closed, they come here to look for medicine. I didn't want them to call you. - That's not what I wanted. - You were screaming. Did you yell? - Why did you move? - To stretch my legs. Can't you obey at least once? - Any news from Eliott? - No, no news. I talked to Milo, he is at home. They were together an hour ago, she doesn't know where Eliott is. And he doesn't answer. Do not worry. Yes, but there is a lot of violence out there. Don't worry, have faith. - Wedding ring? - I have faith. Make gauze with Betadine. Can I drive? I have to drive tonight. He can't put his foot down, how can he drive? I'll lose my job. I went to the demonstration in my spare time, I'm wrong. Bend your toes, please. Perfect, again... Great. - Do you hear here? - Yup. Optimal. Now raise your leg. We remove the splinters on the surface, then do an x-ray. If it's okay, I'll put the stitches on her and go home. Otherwise, we operate. Can't I do the X-ray later? We need to see if there are any splinters deep, especially near an artery. How much does an x-ray cost me? Nothing, we are in a public hospital, in France, until proven otherwise, the treatments are free. Can I lie down next to you? That pill knocked me out. Take the bed, if you want, I can walk a little. Go to the waiting room and leave me the bed? I love you. I just want to lie down for a moment. I close my eyes... for a few seconds. - You come. - Then I'll be all yours. You are all mine! - Do I sing you a lullaby? - No. Lord, I understand that it hurts, but I need you to stay still. - Are you sure you don't want painkillers? - I don't want stuff that puts you to sleep! - What's his job? - Truck driver. - For a long time? - Yup. - Isn't that too hard? - I like. My father was a truck driver. He took me with him, I liked him, we traveled at night. We crossed the cities at dawn. Fuck! Piano! I'm sorry. Raphaëlle Catania, weight fall on the elbow. Let me see your arm. I did not understand anything. He wants to see your arm, he's the doctor. I do what I can. You need an x-ray. What a find! Spare the comments, we are overwhelmed tonight. I'm going to find someone. - Let him work, no comments. - A real Einstein. I carry it, apparently I am also a stretcher bearer. Nobel Prize of Medicine! He'll tell me his name, so I'll sign it. Seriously... do you think it's broken? I don't know, that's why we do an x-ray. He's in a bad way. How much does it hurt, from 0 to 10? 0 not at all, 10 very much. - How many? - I do not know. 11, 12, also 15. Stop the bullshit, you have been treating me badly for half an hour. I repeat: 0 not at all, 10 is like biting her arm off. 10 and a half, okay? No, forget it. Did Tramadol do anything to you? - Did they give you Tramadol? - As soon as she arrives, she is in her folder. Could I have some Lamaline, with a drop of opium? It is not on request. It could be dangerous before an hour. - Did they give you Tramadol? - Patricia, are you taking her to the rays? You lie to me and mix the medicines... Sorry. It's dangerous and I hate it when you lie. You know I can't stand it! - He didn't do anything to me. - You look crazy! Good evening, lady. What a shame! If anything happens, I'm already in the hospital. Are you happy to be here? Then stay there. Don't count on me, don't ask me for help, I'm leaving. What does it do? I think he's leaving. Can't he go back to follow her? - We're going to the rays. - Please. What's up Would you give me a cigarette? Mr. Caron, your antibiotics. - Do they sleep? - No. No, don't worry. Thank you. Pronto? Yes, who is he? Ready? Tesoro! - Can you hear me? - Where are you? In République, with friends. Call Mom and Valérie. Otherwise, they'll go around the hospitals. They will tell me to go home, I'm with friends, I don't want to go back. - You tell him. - Agree. Where are you? The? To the hospital. - How? Is it serious? - It's nothing. I am giving birth. What are you saying? I hurt my elbow, it's nothing, honey. My love. - Is mom with you? - Yes, she is here. She can't hear you, she's not close. You know, we've been fighting a lot recently. He told me that maybe... What's up? It is as usual. Always fight and then make peace. Don't worry, I'm sure. How dear you are. You have a heart of gold, I love you. I tell you... I reassure you. Can I take a token? Go. The arcade is over there. Thank you. Fuck, can you hear it? It does not stop. - Did you know anything about your son? - No, still nothing. These fucking demonstrations scare me. That's not what I meant, though... I'm so violent. I called my daughters to reassure them. How old are they? - 17, 15, 13 and 10. Do you have 4 daughters? Yeah, 4. Manifesto for them. Did they visit your friend? Not yet, he played down the injuries, it will take time. Sorry. That girl moves me. Reminds me of Myriam. - Do you remember Myriam? - Yes, I remember it. You two were funny together. You know, I'm still with Mélanie. Let's go on, let's resist. - Have you ever left Valenciennes? - No. I work in Lille as a waiter for shit wages, at La Chicory. Chicory... What do you do? I am a publisher. - Publisher? - Comics. Not bad. Do you camp there? Before Yes. Before Yes? Not now? What balls! Are you filming? Look. What is that? - 15,000 views. A friend of mine shot it. - It's crazy! - We are many here to support you. What the fuck. Yes I know? Have you seen the video? It is total madness. - Thank you. - You are welcome. My mother must not see it! I have to bring the truck back tomorrow or I'm screwed. Yup. Yup. Shit battery fuck! Do you want mine? I heard they arrested a lot of far-right activists. We're not fascists, okay? I was just saying... A friend of mine was arrested for wearing a balaclava. The hospital is collapsing! Everything is fine? - Yes. - No injuries? I call maintenance. Thing? The maintenance? The health service falls apart. Is fine? - Yes thanks. And she? - I'm fine. - Is fine? - Yes I'm fine. - Don't you want my phone? - Okay, thanks. So do you drive trucks? Are you interested in heavy vehicles now? I like to draw trucks, I've done a lot of them. - What is driving, exactly? - Whatever they give me. I just started with a 26 tons, tomorrow I have 15 deliveries in Paris... It will not be easy. I don't mean... - She's in shit too, isn't she? - Yeah, I'm in shit. I broke my elbow, I can't work and my girlfriend is leaving me. And you... she... What happened to his leg? They shot me, like I was a rabbit. It is funny? Excuse me. Forgive me, I mixed the medicines and I imagined her... who was a rabbit on the Champs-Elysées. That's what happened. I ran off like a rabbit. It's crazy, we were all together and, out of the blue, there was war. Hand grenades, tear gas, people in panic. - It was hell. - What did you expect? It wasn't what I came for. I wanted Macron to come out of the Elysee palace and told us: "Okay guys, I get it, let's talk about it. Let's discuss it as men. "Period! - Did you really think he would? - Why not? Shouldn't a President listen to the people? If we had been bankers, wouldn't he have gone out? - Probably. - Immediately. The fact is, he doesn't think our anger is legitimate. And then I thought, "Fuck... what was our mistake?" We went upstairs, but if we went downstairs... Wait, I don't understand. We arrived and marched to the Elysée, riot police everywhere. - If we went through the sewers... - I get it! - The Elysée has sewers. - Like everything. They poop there too. I didn't mean that conduit! We would have arrived in the square and we would have talked. Talking is all I wanted. I have to move it a little to focus. Like this... Can you keep your head like that? Stay like this for 2 seconds. Don't move and don't breathe. Man, it doesn't work. Excuse me, usually I don't. I don't know how to maneuver well. Works? Yup. - I breathed a little. - Okay, but now you can't breathe anymore. Your head, lady. You turn it around. Hold your breath. Ecco. Let me out, please! - Immediately. - Get me down. You lower me. How many layers! There are parasites. - Give me the acetaminophen. - I arrive. Julie Bataille, I'll call you back as soon as possible. Julie, why did you leave? I can't do it without you. I can't defend myself. - Here you are! - Yup. Did Eliott tell you where he is? Half an hour ago he was still in République. What are you doing there? He is with friends, he was calm. Why don't you call me? Because he fears you, you are strict. Bullshits. Sure, I'm a pain in the ass. Have you seen the doctor? No. What's up? A piece of broken bone here. - You see it? - Yup. Shit... I do not see it. I don't know, let's wait for the doctor. He was very nice to me on the phone. And kind Eliott. He is reserved, but very attentive to others. - A real treasure. - Yup? Well, you find out now, but I already know. Usually you criticize it, but today you are in love with it. I don't criticize him. You know, I think we were a little worn out. I understand that it must be difficult... live with me, I always complain. I have to change. You will think you don't make me happy, instead, you make me very happy. Very happy. Maybe we could go on? Find a solution? Let's not talk about it now. You've never been with someone like me. Come on, admit it! Okay, I'll stop begging. Begging is not pleasant, it is not sexy, I'm very sexy, so I'll stop. So I order you to continue being with me. It's sexy to say "I order you". Wait up! Julie, please wait! - Julie, please! - Are you crazy? You can't scream like that. We are in the hospital, there are people who suffer, about to die, the nurses are working. Do you want to stick it in your head? You are not the only one. You never think about others, I can't take it anymore. Look, listen... Stop that! You can be kind, you make an effort, you can do it. No Yes... A little while ago, for example, I met a person. We talked, I met a yellow vest. What did you ask him? If he voted for Le Pen, I bet. I am not a caricature. We talked, I found it fantastic. A little crazy, but full of energy and also of candor. He's the guy from the coffee machine. I challenge you to have met, he shouts as much as you do. You are made for each other, now you also have a poor friend. You said a nasty thing. It moved me, that's all. It struck me, moved me. You don't have to be sarcastic every time you talk about emotions. He thought Macron would come out of the Elysée to talk to them. But then he is really stupid! Cretin, but not deaf! Who does he think he is? I'm not an idiot and I didn't vote for Le Pen. - Fun. - He is not. You have no sense of humor. If she regrets voting for Macron, too bad for her. Sir, don't you forget something? Lady? Lady, are you okay? No. Excuse us! I'm sorry! My friend is not angry with you, she is angry with me! What he said is not true. He's right, I'm his poor friend. Do not say that! I wasn't born in cotton wool, mine were teachers. They took me to demonstrations, I know every route of the demonstrations. - I believed in the revolution for years. - And now you don't care! Why didn't you come to these demonstrations? Aren't they chic enough? Don't say this! I have always been... Are you OK? It hurts. You deserve me to leave you there. Don't be a bastard, help me. Wait up... Fuck! Mica weight 200 kg! - Are you OK? - Yup. Everything will be fine with your friend. I'm not so sure. He can't stand me anymore, I think. Do you have a girlfriend? It's not easy if you live with your mother and you can't afford a restaurant. You talk like a real macho. - Like what? - A macho. Take her to the park for a sandwich. We live in two different worlds. Why do you say this? Do I bring a fridge bag with sandwiches? On a park bench. I love the benches! You kiss and then eat... an apple. What happens? - Why are you here? - This is Einstein. Let's talk about class struggle. Go back to your box immediately. Yes, sir. At the x-ray. - Was she injured at the demonstration? - No. Do you mind? Indeed, yes. What the fuck is that question? It's broken, we have to operate. No! The surgeon's overworked tonight, so we're casting her for now. What happens? Did you see how many injured? It's getting worse, look. You bastards! Sorry, there is no pediatric unit here. The child is sick, I have to see Kim, I'm her husband. Leave them alone! They did nothing! We have rights! Nobody listens to us! The gate! Open it the fuck up! Shit! Get off! You are crazy? Is fine? - Is fine? - I'm fine. Come in! Soon! Don't touch your eyes. Hurry up! Quick, don't stop. There are news? - Anything. - And on the Internet? Nothing, they say everything is calm. But something is happening! Julie Bataille. I'll call you back... Julie, call me, please. Have you ever seen an emergency room close? - Why are the police here? - It's not for you, calm down. - Where's Kim? - He's coming. We can't talk to the manager. - Nobody answers. - You can't breathe! - This gentleman has a baby. - We're not letting anyone in. Is absurd. Pat! - What are you doing here, Jalil? - Kim doesn't answer, the girl is hot. Come with me. Will you open the door for me? Let it pass! Permit! Now someone is coming for you. - Let us in! - Can't breathe! Wait up... Put it here. Girls, cardiac arrest! Blandine? - Where do we put it? - Leave it here, there is no room. Michele, ventilation! Naïla, drip. Here she is. - Shit! - Where is the person responsible? Call him. 1:30 am, I start the heart massage. Enter, but one at a time. Come on, leave the entrance free. Go to the waiting room. Okay. - Is she alone? - Yup. What do we have? Ah, though! The women in labor must be moved, the gas arrived on maternity leave. It hurts here. - Where is it? - When I breathe. Nurse, this lady is not well. We arrive immediately. What does it mean? He's not fine. Let's go right back. Help us! Let us pass, please. Get in line. We don't want to move on, but don't breathe! How long? - 2 minutes. - Previous episodes? - Not that I know of, check the folder. The drip. Naïla, tell me when you are ready. Stop the massage, I need to see the pulse. Well, let's proceed with the download. Free! First download. We have a heartbeat. Kim, continue. Prepare 1mg of adrenaline. Put second drip. Intubate. - I'll make it. - Sedative. No children here! She is the daughter of a colleague. Kim, I'll take care of it! 40 years old, cardiac arrest on X-ray. - Defibrillator? - One rush, 1mg of adrenaline. - Do you have the intubation kit? - Yup. How long, Kim? - 4 minutes. 4 minutes of massage, one discharge, now it is asystolic. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30... Ready to ventilate. Stop, I have something. He's gone! Take his blood pressure and we bring him to resuscitation. Set it to 15. Immediately in resuscitation, they are waiting for him. Oxygen okay. Here we go. Nice work, girls. Let us in! I'll break down the door! Stop that! Stop that! What's now? He sees that he is suffering! - How are you? - He has bronchiolitis. She's a little better, we put her on a drip to hydrate her. And we keep an eye on it. - Treasure. - Sorry if I panicked. - The fever didn't go down. - You did well, I had to stay home. I shouldn't have come to disturb you. Everything will be fine, my baby. Honey where are you? Did you leave? We are trapped in the waiting room. I'm fine, it's just they won't let me in. I'm coming now. I said they won't let me in, I'll come as soon as I can. It is not heard. You can't hear it! What happens? Pronto? I'm in pediatrics, I'm coming. I can not believe it! I have to get back to work, honey. Mom loves you so much. All right? I'll be back to see you soon. Sorry, Jal, I have to go. Attention please. The rioters attacked the police. The administration has decided to temporarily close the hospital. Please keep calm and discipline. - Calm down. - There are too many of you, it's dangerous. We can't let you in. This is resuscitation, it is too dangerous for patients. What happens? How many? - About 20. Calm down. He has to decide. What do you want to do? Calm down! They are coming, they will slaughter us! They are talking. We let everyone in, but calmly. Are you sure? We risk a disciplinary action. I take responsibility for it, we let them pass through the basement. - Sorry, but... - I take responsibility. We make them go from the basement to the main square. - I'll handle that. - I come. Me too. Calm down, please. Now we let you in, even if it is forbidden. Remember, you are in a hospital. Follow me, but stay calm. Thank you. Slowly. We are here. What do you have? Follow me. Stay calm, we are in resuscitation. Stay together. What happened? Here are the cops! - Force. - Close the door. - Do you let the demonstrators in? - They are not demonstrators, they are patient. I will report. Do you feel better? Breathe, breathe... Yes, we set priorities, I keep you informed. We'll catch later. - This part is done. - Good. - Lady? - I'm scared! Don't worry, there is a bit of confusion, but everything is under control. I put oxygen on you, check the car, call me if you need it. This is a cure zone, we call you one at a time, okay? He downplayed the injuries. Ariola, Johnny! Now I'll let her in. Excuse me, permission. - What's up? - This girl is not well. What do you feel? Yes, he can't breathe! Come with me. I carry it inside. Let the lady pass. We are doing our best. Come with me Wait a moment. Slowly, breathe in well. - Is there a free box? - Everyone busy. There is a bed in mine. Thank you, Mr. Caron, but sit down again. Almost there, ma'am. - What are you doing in this way? - Are you OK? What have you done? - You're not comfortable. - All right. Make yourself comfortable. - Let me see your eyes. - They burn. Fuck... It is hell. So? Have you seen the doctor? - It's broken, but it's not serious. - Yes it's serious. What did they say? Do they operate? - Yes, but they don't know when. - But how? They have to operate immediately! Cough, please. Yet. Kim? We do a chest MRI. Are you taking it? Yes, so let's do it first. Gather your things, sir. I got the result of your x-ray. It's not bad, but there are a lot of splinters. - We need to clean everything in the operating room. - Can't they do it in Nîmes tomorrow? She cannot drive. - Can you hear the mess out there? - What do I do? It has to wait, there is nothing else to do. How long do I have to wait? I have no read, sorry. Sorry. Where the fuck are they? - Naïla, did you find them? - I'm looking for. Why is the stretcher in this state? Pat, there are only these, in the meantime take them, I'm going to get more. - He needs help? - Yes maybe. Kiss Me. No, stop it. We're calling, we're doing our best. Is this where it hurts? You look at me. Have you taken any painkillers? Agree. I need a doctor! - What happened? - I fell from the stairs. Does your leg feel it? Open your eye. All right? Relax. Piano. Bene. What happened to her? We were demonstrating, I didn't understand they were going to load. I haven't heard the warnings. I didn't run, I didn't feel in danger, since I hadn't done anything. So I kept walking slowly, because I hadn't done anything. One of them got me. He threw me to the ground, he crushed my head to the ground, he fingered my nose and started beating me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I couldn't know. - Excuse me... - Don't worry. It's all over, now it's safe, here we are. Do you want a physiological? Can you put it on? Mr. Prunier, this is Yann. Just to tell her I'm a little late but deliveries will be on time. I'm sorry, I have to go. Thank you. - Do you really want to lose your leg? - I have to go. Is fine? Her waters broke. - Is fine? - Yup. I'm confused, sorry... You have to roll it out. I unhook this. Everything is fine? - Everything is fine? - No! Continue. - Do I bend your legs? - Yup. Bend your legs, lady. This is done, the legs are bent. Have you ever seen giving birth with your legs stretched out? Yes Madam. - We can't get her to give birth. - We will see. Doesn't she have a husband or something? - There's not always a husband. - I'm just asking! Where? Yes, accept the pain. - I'm going to call someone. - Go! Calm down. I will be right back! Inhale calmly, like this! I want to push. - No, you don't have to. - Yup. I have to wait. Breathe in and accept the pain. Like this! Let's try the dog's breath? You look at me. You look at me. Give me your hand. You look at me. Strong string. What are you doing here? I've been looking for it everywhere. Breathe calmly, don't push. Breathe calmly. Watch your arm. Who is with her? - Are you the father? Do you want to come? - No thank you. - Are you OK? - My head is spinning. Wait, I'll get a stretcher. Can we get a stretcher? We say goodbye? You can't go out. Don't worry, I'll do it. Wait up. I drew you, look. - It's me? - Yup. Do you like? Yup. It would have been better if I had drawn with the right. No, it's nice. Thank you. You can hang it in your truck. It is really cool. Mrs. Catania, where is your stretcher? I lent it. - Have you seen my friend? - No, I haven't seen her. - What are you doing here? - I'm leaving. He knows it's not possible, don't go away. Do you need help? - Adrien, you can't go in. - What about him? - It is going away. - Why did you call the cops? Why did you call them? I did not. - And why am I here? - I didn't call them. You gave my name! All our names! He gave all our names. What are you saying? Did he blurt out our names? Go back to the waiting room. - Did they ask him? - I did not! - Who asked him? - You get out and you lie down. I `ll kill you! I undress you all! Close the door! Mr. Square Head, close or I'll kill it. Lock the door with the furniture! Do as he says, please. - It's hurting the lady. - I waited for it! She told me she was coming back. I waited for her, but she never came back. I bet and I lost! And what did you bet, you idiot? My life! Kim, are you okay? What is happening? You, shut up! I'll kill him if you don't shut up! Get out! Shut up! It's hurting her. A psychiatric patient barricaded himself with Kim and two other patients. - I called the police. - Did you call the police? - Yes, he called her. - She has a knife, I think. - We need to calm him down. - He cannot enter. My wife is inside. Just stare at me! Shut the fuck up! It's dangerous? With drugs, no, but we don't know. - We called the police. - How do they get in? Everything is blocked! They will use another entry. How soon will they arrive? Excuse me. How does he help her if he keeps holding her that way? I don't trust her. I lost faith when he called the cops. I didn't call anyone. How does he help you if he can't move? It can't help you. Put it down. What you say is logical, but I don't. I'm not logical now! What is stopping you? This is not the problem! So what is it? The problem is I don't know... I don't know why I'm here. So come with me, let's get out of here. Do you smoke? Do you smoke a cigarette with me? Go smoke outside if you want, but I'm keeping Kim. You're a cop, right? You're trying to convince me! - I'm not a cop, I'm a demonstrator. - Why should I trust you? Look what the cops did to me. No, the cops get hurt too. Are you a cop too? Tell me, I don't know! We are not cops! Fuck, tell me! Go with him, nothing will happen to you. We are on the same side. Adrien, look at his leg. - I can trust you? - Of course. Kim is not the problem. Alone. Take his legs. Kim! Put it on its side. Kim, help me, please! They will kill me! - On the back. - Piano, he just didn't take the medicines. It is not dangerous. Asshole! I'll break your face! - I hate you! - Don't look at him. I'm here, Adrien. - They'll kill me. - Take it easy. - My heart is stopping! - Breathe. There is no need to suffocate it! Kim, alone! They want to kill me! I have nothing to say, I'm sorry. If I hadn't been so busy, it wouldn't have happened. He hurt her. Don't you want to report him? No I do not want to. It should, every complaint proves how badly things work. I said I don't want to report him. I'm busy, can I go? Thank you. - Good work. - You too. Elodie, I'm Dr. Dufour, the doctor on duty. He has broken ribs and there is blood around his lungs. This explains his breathing problems. We hospitalize her... Are you sure? The pain is not that bad. Does it hurt with every breath? Yup. This is not normal, Elodie. Mr. Caron, where are you running? Come with me. Good news, they can operate it now. - Now? - Yup. Get on the stretcher, I'll bring you a gown. I can do it, thanks! I will be right back. Excuse me. Kim needs her in box 1. - Needle? - Si. Why are you still in République? We were blocked, riot officers surrounded us for 2 hours. You are unconscious! - Are you OK? - Do you realize? Now go home, Eliott. So you always worry. - Ignore her, honey. - But in short! You never update me, of course you worry me. Stop putting yourself on his side, you broke! You look like two teenagers. It is not a competition to see who is more right! - I'm just trying to make things right. - No, you're just messing around. Stop fighting for me! Until tomorrow. We're not fighting, Eliott! So you don't help me, see? He hung up on me after I hadn't heard from him for hours. Everything I say is wrong... I don't say anything anymore. You have to learn to shut up every now and then. You always have to interfere. I'll be quiet dead. I'll believe it when I see it. Do you want to organize a funeral for a broken arm? Will you be sad when I die? Maybe you've got me so bored it'll be a relief. I can say: "Finally!" Will you cry a lot? I do not know. You'll miss me? You kissed me hard, I said I don't want to kiss you. - True. - You didn't ask me for permission. It is not done. Excuse me, I had to urinate in the corner. I've been on the street for over 15 hours. What a mess. Really... it is war. They've been making us wait for hours, I can't take it anymore. They should have let us charge first. Things got worse, we panicked. There was shooting from all sides. I also have a colleague in the ER. He is wounded? Gentleman! Come this way, go. All right, guys. I really admire it. It's kind, but I think I'll be leaving soon. I understand. If they all leave, they will understand that something is wrong. By law, we have a limit of 3 nights per week. This is the sixth I do. We cannot sacrifice ourselves, always, like this... without any respect. Neither for us nor for our work. As a child, I dreamed of having plaster. - For real? - This is the first. I wanted... for people to write on it. - I draw comics. - For real? It will be a phenomenon to draw on his chalk. The internist told her that before discharging her will he do another x-ray? No? We need a new X-ray to see that nothing has moved. I wanted to say hi. - So they reopened? - Yup. They're plastering my friend, then let's go. How's Elodie? We are waiting. I hope he gets along. It was good to see you, anyway. For me too. Did you see how much morphine they gave me? Maybe he'll help me draw. Don't be toxic! You have to take it only when needed. I can walk. So go. Come on, wait! Come on, sit down. We can't hold the chair. Of course we can keep it. Security will stop us. Go, faster! Faster! Faster! And he! I'll be right back. Signor Caron, mi sente? Mr. Caron, this is Kim. Mi stringa la mano, se mi sente. What happened? An accident, his truck overturned.
