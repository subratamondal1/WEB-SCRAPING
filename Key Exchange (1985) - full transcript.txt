Rogers is coming into view now. Hold it! There's a rider attempting a breakaway. It's number 78, Philip Bailey. Get out of the way! Hey you! Watch out! Aaaah! Are you ok? What hurts? Oh, my head. What? I'm bleeding. Don't bleed. Give me your shirt. What? Give me your shirt. Stay. Give me your phone number. What? Oh. I guess I'm ok. Is he bad? Oh, yeah. He's bad. Are you all right? A hazard, man. That was a hell of a spill. To be in France. France? If we want to have a race or maybe compete in a club event, we got to share a six-mile drive with joggers, roller skaters, little monsters who'll smack you off your bike with a baseball bat. In France, they clear towns you know what I'm talking about? I think so. Did you spend time there? No, I never been. I've seen guys like Bernard hinault. I seen them on wide world of sports. You ought to go there. I plan to go sometime. Those god damn houdaille guys. Power camps. I'm dying to see those guys lose. Well, we almost had them today. Philip Bailey. I'm Michael fine. Ok. She lives here. Maybe I shouldn't come in. Come on, man. You'll get your second wind. Lisa! Here I am! I brought some help! Lisa, this is Michael. Michael, Lisa. I'm so proud of you. Come on. Thanks. Lisa. Cerveza? I feel like I've drunk for days. Big night? Very. Saloons? No. Party? Sort of. I got married yesterday. Congratulations! They said it wouldn't last. She had to work today. Together? Honeymoon? We're going to eleuthera over Christmas. What does your wife do? Your wife. That's funny. That's the first time anybody's said that. Do you like it? I like it a lot. It sounds official-- "your wife." Makes me feel proud, responsible. So what does your wife do? This choreographer is working up this new piece for her. But the day after your wedding? We decided to postpone the honeymoon. Working today was important to her, so it's important to me. You don't think I'm being too personal? No, go ahead. I've seen you around the park. We're from the same general gene pool. Eymoon so your wife could rehearse. The rehearsal is the usual thing. The day after you're married is unusual. Both are important. We made a choice. She owes you one? No, no. It's not like that. We both decided she would work today. Man, no offense. I'm just trying to understand. What do you mean "same gene pool"? It's this theory I have. You meet somebody. You get a sense that you think alike. You like the same kinds of women. It's not your background, individual experiences. You have this essential structure in common. You know what I mean? I do now. What do you do? You hate me, right? Great. Very good. Have you read any of Philip's other books? He's great. He's one of my best writers. You want to mill? Sure. ♪ People are talking all over town ♪ ♪ playing you up, but putting you down ♪ This is where the water goes. This is where your head goes. Faster, faster.

She's a great girl. Who? Lisa? Isn't she your girl? No, just seeing her. Sleeping with her. Usual thing. Uh-huh. I see other women. She sees other men. It's not your exclusive situation. It's open? Yeah, right. I don't know. As Paul Newman said, when you can have steak at home?" What if you want pizza? You make a choice. Give up pizza. I like having my cake and my cupcake, too. Know what I mean? You're sure? Mm-hmm. You'll be careful? Trust me. Ok. Ready? Mm-hmm. I'm George. When did we double date? You other folks come back another time. Tomorrow, cellulite in men, the secret shame, and straightening up your room, what doctors say. Until then, good day, New York. Ok, everybody, that's a wrap. This is the best he could do? He's in the control room. Who wants to see twins? Siamese, maybe. I thought they were fabulous. We've had worse. The eskimo wives were worse. Twins are always good. Frank, as soon as you're feeling better, would you come to my office, please? Your I.D. Is a fake. You're an illegal alien. Do you understand, piero? That's what they'll ask you at immigration. Piero. This is incredible. It's a fish. Fish. Fish. Fish. Fish. Fish. You're very talented. Gracias. [Knock knock] Can I speak to you? Yeah. Ok, piero. Here. You take this form. Fill this out. Give it to Helen when you're done. Did you read my brief? We'll talk about it tomorrow. I'm doing pro bono work. I admire you for that. My work with Cameron comes first. Fine, but I've got IBM coming soon. Not now, loraine. Give me five minutes with you, I'll give you five minutes with me. Five minutes with my parole officer, I'm queen of the hop. Make sure piero gets home. Five minutes! I'll call your parole officer. If there's anything I can do for you! Superman! You signed US up, didn't you? We're all set. We're a team. Think we got a chance? We got four weeks to get in shape. We're pretty fast. All right. Coming through! No. It's like a slingshot! Stay on my wheel, then break away fast. Those guys won't part like the red sea. Get around them. Pull out! It'll take three workouts a week just to beat this god-damned hill. I'm dying. One last lap. Then we can die. Jesus Christ. So, how's married life? Nothing different, huh? Nope. Well, yeah, maybe... One thing, maybe. What? Well...panties. Panties? When I was seeing different women, I got a real charge out of the different panties they wore, what they looked like in them. Ne woman's arsenal of underwear. I've lived with her for 1 1/2 years. I know them all by heart. Buy her some new ones. I did. It's not the same thing. Have a daughter. Look forward to her wonder years. Nice. So you fool around. What's the big deal? I don't want to fool around. N. It's been laboratory tested. No, I'm faithful to her. She deserves it. Can you pull that off for an extended period? Very extended. I love her. It's hard enough to make it work without bringing in other people. Right. I can still be attracted to another woman without actually jumping on her bones. I guess so. Ooh, Lisa! To the concert. Want to come? Tonight? I can't. I'm meeting a detective. Take Michael. Do you want to go? Sure. I should call. Your wife's rehearsing. Right. Sure. See? Got you a date. But breakfast tomorrow-- Isn't she some dame? Hi, Michael. Angelo carabello? Get rid of the wheezer. I want to thank you for letting me watch. You write detective stories. You know what I think about detective stories? They're full of shit. Action, action, action. They never seen a real detective. That's why I'm here. Those stories are too fantastical. What do you mean that's why you're here? I'm writing a detective novel. Tell me what it's really like. What it's really like? It's boring! Oh! I'm sorry! I'm asleep. I mean I was... Just sleeping. I'll have to remember Bye-bye. Good morning. That was her. That's her? She lives and works up there. She's magnificent. That's why I quit the force. Can I drop you somewhere? I'm supposed to meet somebody for coffee. Light or dark? Drop me at national TV. Mayor koch, what is New York City's financial condition today? Terrific. We didn't seven years ago when we had a billion dollar deficit. I say to people, "you can make it in New York City." Thank you very much, mayor koch. We'll be ready to tape in five minutes. Everybody, don't be nervous. This is going to be fun. Trim the cables. We can't afford more casualties. Lis? Take a message. Check the focus somewhere else. Oh, there you are. Tell me about the steriles. David, don't say steriles. Oh? What do I say? They're infertile couples. Infertile is the word. Have you been using salad dressing on your hair? I've tried loosening them up. These people are dead except for the Andersons. She's the superbitch, and he's pretty unhinged himself. You might get sparks out of them. You can be penetrating without being rude. These people are even duller than the mercy killers. I'll do my best. Excuse me. Would you come with me? Uh, where... That's fine. This way. I want to see right here. That's fine. Relax. Can we have 3 up on the floor, please? How did you get this number? Not a moment too soon. Last chance, anybody. We're about to take 1. Please, everybody take your seats. We're ready on the floor. Ng, 2. Jesus Christ! 5, 4... Quiet! 2... Cue! Infertility-- it's not a dirty word. It's a problem facing the couples joining US today. From Oklahoma city, Oklahoma, John and Marie dencher. From kew gardens here in New York, Sam and Alice lish-- I got that wrong. Minneapolis, Minnesota, Henry and Greta Anderson, the parents of six adopted children. My word. And, um... Last but not least, Philip Bailey. I can't seem to find here... I'm an infertile single. He is not infertile. He is my boyfriend. Millions don't know they're sterile are you sterile or infertile? I didn't do the sperm count myself. Certainly, you don't want children unless you're married. The problem for sterile singles is who wants to marry US? What woman would want to marry a man who can't make babies? My husband can't make babies, but I wouldn't trade him for anyone. Would you have married him that he was shooting blanks? Oh, my lord, Lisa. Mr. Anderson, possibly the most important decision you've ever faced-- marriage, fatherhood-- and you didn't take the time-- five minutes-- to make sure everything was hunky-dory in the genitalia department. He's gorgeous. He's a lunatic. Bailey, so you just knew, huh? I've never used a condom and half the girls I dated didn't use anything either. I started thinking and went to the doctor. They put you in this room, they give you a copy of penthouse magazine, and they give you this little, uh, it looks like a Dixie cup. Sure. The doctor counts your sperm. I was a couple short. Couple short. When my father married Judith, she was half his age. He was checked out just the way I described. I'd love to meet your father. I wouldn't trust you two together. Housewives will be calling the station. You could be the sterile Burt Reynolds. Hey. I really am sorry about breakfast this morning. Forgive me? I forgive you. Did I get my key back? What? You took my keys so you could drop my laundry off. I need them back. Your check. But I need them Thursday night. , this keeps happening. Get another set made. And you'll keep those? We have keys to each other's apartments. Say you meet some guy and hit it off, or say I meet some girl and it's a mutual attraction. We have a drink and then grab a cab. Your place or mine? There's no decision to be made because you've got a key. I don't know if you'll come by, so it's off to her place where I climb over two roommates and do it quietly on the floor "because my roommate has to be up early." I'll resent you because your having the key don't sweet-talk me. I'm just being honest! Let's drop it! I'm late for work! Oh! Christ, you make me crazy sometimes! So you're picking it up again! Yes, I am! You harangue about a zipless fuck and then say you're being honest. P safe distance. You act like you're being led around by your cock. I'm not buying it. You're going to analyze me now. Maybe you've got some inkblots for me. Ooh! It could be like exchanging gifts, the thing about the keys. It's more like a pact. You mean exclusively? Yes, exclusively. More than you and me and it's not a couple. I see what you mean. We did casual real well. "Hi, how are you? Saturday night?" "Ok. Call me to make sure." La de da! I'd like to see what would happen rd would show up. Ok, strike commitment. How about an agreement? If there's a trust between US, will papa Hemingway still ask you out? All right, Lisa. I can't do casual anymore. You could just stop seeing other men? It wasn't me who insisted it was important we see other people. You made such a big deal out of it. I have a confession to make. I haven't been seeing other men. You haven't? For how long? Almost since the beginning. That's over four months. I know. What about the doctor? I made him up. Your old boyfriend? That actor? We had a drink. That's all. I didn't want you to feel pressured, so I invented a busy sex life. I didn't meet anyone else I wanted to be with. Do you understand? I'm not saying, "let's get married," or even, "let's live together." But I can't say, "well, it was just an idea." I can't pretend not to want more. I thought of the Indian brave in the forest. He alerts to the smallest sign of danger-- a leaf turned the wrong way to the wind, ly silence, the far-off snapping of a twig. That's what you thought of when she asked you for your keys? I distinctly heard a twig snap. Isn't she great? She's beautiful. Can I help you? It's under control. Where are they? In the pas de deux. The pas de deux? Pas de deux. When's your number come up? What? Never mind. Don't ever change. Stay just like you are. Glad you could make it. The guy at the hardware store wouldn't shut up. I can't help myself! He can't help himself! You can't help yourself, and he can't help himself. So now you're out there together I've been trying to rationalize these feelings away-- the pressure from the wedding, the intimacy of working together-- but I can't. I'm thinking about him. That's not fair to US. I can't sneak around. I've got to figure out what I'm doing. I can't live in limbo. Can't you hold off on fucking physical attraction is part of what's between US. Anyway, it's my body! The Chinese stuff? Super Ben-gay. You're kidding? I mean, I was crazy! I've never seen myself like that. If they're so hot for each other, let them feel like firecrackers. So... She packs up. Now she's off staying with her girlfrnd. I told her as she was walking out the door. Told her what? About the tiger balm in the diaphragm jelly. It was a good idea, but you couldn't not tell her. I told her on the stairs. You know what she does? I'm expecting to get smacked, screamed at, something. She says, "thank you, don't give up on me." That's nice. She should have hit me. Why didn't she hit me? Shit! I don't know. I'm not naive. I knew something like this could happen. But I figured she'd be on tour or meet some older guy who sweeps her off her feet with his wisdom. I wasn't prepared for this. You couldn't be. Not less than two months after we get married, right under my fucking nose! Do you want to get a drink? No. I think I'll go home. I think you should get drunk. That only works in old frank Sinatra songs. You put a buzz on, then you go home and pass out. That's not the answer. It isn't the answer. It's just something you do, like a ritual. Aaah! Ok, let's get up. What are you doing? ♪ You can have her ♪ ♪ I don't want her ♪ ♪ she didn't love me ♪♪ Easy. Come on. Seymour, Seymour, Seymour. There are 10 Kennedy children, and each of them had 10 children. Frank. Why are we talking about this? Producers take care of this. You called? Where is frank? What do you need? Frank's at the lab. We don't use a lab. We shoot tape. Ght. Bye-bye. You can't keep covering up for him. Frank's going through a rough period. His life. With or without frank, we did a 30 share last week. How about that, hmm? I don't feel like celebrating alone. You want to eat? Thank you. One of those, two of those, plus she got the house in Westchester plus the condo in park city. I got the kids on Sunday. But I'm not complaining. You must have been young when you got married. These are good. I'll have this guy cater my next party. The final kilometer of the Paris classic.

I'm glad to hear that. She left me. I'm sorry. You're not leaving. Not your fault, I guess. Philip. Hey, li. Uh, April left me. Oh, Michael. What happened? That choreographer-- whoops! Come on, Mike. Come on, Michael! Leave him, Philip. No, I better get going. Philip! Philip! There's no need to leave. No. I'm going to leave you two. Nice seeing you again. Same here. Philip. I told you so. [Pop] Your friend made one big mistake. You hear? You made a mistake. Really? What was that? You saw her point of view. Never give up the upper hand. Are you listening? Like, take her, for instance. God, she's gorgeous. Why waste it on that doctor? It's hard to get doctors to make house calls. You're a writer. You win, or you lose. You're wrong. He is right. What do you know? Two stories? Yeah, there's two stories-- sooner or later. Sooner or later, what? Sooner or later, everybody loses. "Yeah, said escovar, "his lip curling up to a smile. Sooner or later, everybody loses." I was my mistake. I should have... You should have what? I had to find out. You're not interested. No, it's not that. Oh? I wonder what Johnny does in these situations. That's what I always ask myself. [Jackhammers] Ah! You scared the shit out of me! I'm sorry. Anything I can do to make it up to you? Hmm? Shouldn't I be mad at you? Oh, nothing happened.

I'm cooking him dinner. You want to come? I don't think so. You'd like him, Philip. He's a mystery fan, too. He read me Raymond Chandler stories. He'd do bogart and imitate a saxophone. Everyone feels comfortable with him. Everybody isn't screwing his daughter. That's ridiculous. It's the nut of the situation. He doesn't care about that. He cares, believe me. It will hit him that this guy across the table is doing his daughter every which way. That's baloney. See? You don't understand. What? Exchanging keys or the tampax in your bathroom or all the times you blow something out of proportion and see yourself getting stuck. Lisa. Friday at 8:00. Be there. These don't say that they got a number going. I'll pop out of the closet. That's all there is to it? I'm surprised at you. We put the girl with her husband. You got to be a bastard to do this. Tomorrow I meet the wife. You haven't met her? No. Tonight is a wrap? Yeah, one more day. I feel like a sauna. Do me a favor. I owe you. You hold down the fort? I got to be at Lisa's at 7:30. Her father is coming. I'll be back by 6:00. Meeting with her father? Oh! Ha ha ha! Tablecloth on 1. Tableware, silverware, and glassware. What's the Chinese guy doing? Decorates food. You'll love him. The flower arranger is on 3. He's got a show on cable. What is on 4? He sculpts ice. He's fantastic. He's our only problem, but it's solved. No sweat. He doesn't speak English. The Chinese? No, the ice guy. You'll ask him four questions on cue sheets. Piero has immigration problems. He has to show he's not taking anyone's job. How many Americans can make birds out of ice? You'd be surprised. If he's on your show, he's special. What are we running here? You'll save this guy from being deported. He should marry an American. My ex-wife is available. I'd save a fortune. David. See this? Who actually buys your sculpture? Rich people. You do other animals? Fish, deer. Who's the most important person who bought one? Leonard Bernstein. Who taught you to sculpt? My father. This looks all right? You're not stoned, are you? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. We have time for a few more questions. Such a beautiful bird. You do other animals other than birds? Rich people. I guess it's rich people who can... Fish and deer. I bet it was your father who taught you how to do this? Leonard Bernstein. Cue the music. Well, uh... Who would you say is... No, I think that's probably all the time we have. Mr. Carabello, I've come to a decision. I want to do this face to face. You do have the photographs of Dr. Fanshaw and this person? The photographs? Yes! Bring them along. Mrs. Fanshaw, before we break down doors, we should review some possible disadvantages. If you find them in flagrante delicto-- something like that's going on-- how are you going to feel-- break it down. Mind if we knock first? Do you know how ridiculous you look with this girl half your age? She could be Audrey's friend! Do the davises know? You drive with Don Davis every day. He must have told b.J. And the Donnellys. Carabello. Answer me, Walter. Don't keep shaking your head. May I offer a comment here? In my line of work-- I'm not ashamed of it-- I see a lot of couples fall apart. There's nothing I can do to help that. Often there's not much juice left between them. Call it quits too soon, heading for the exit when there's still chances left on the board. That's what's happening here. Maybe it's not for me to say, but I don't think you're finished. What's the prognosis, muffy? Oh, Walter, you big ass. You come home with me now, and never see this young person again. Walter and I were ready for a weekend in Saint Bart's. I could use a change of scenery. Would you like to come? I couldn't. Really, i'm... I really couldn't. You sure? It's my one-time-only offer. It's very nice of you, well... You were only doing your job. And, uh... I was only doing mine. Let me drive you to the airport? I was sure he was going to be here. It's all right. I came to see you. Basically. He's spunky. He's never boring. We laugh at each other's jokes. We're good in bed. I think I'm in love with him. Is he in love with you? Is he in love with me? Yes. No. Maybe. He says he is, this funny little frown-- or he makes a joke. He tags a disclaimer on it. It makes me feel terrible. Accident our Lane, accident their Lane. Rubbernecking. I could try the service road. But that wouldn't work, would it? You see, sometimes you've just got to let Like with Walter this afternoon. I mean, there really wasn't any point. Was there, Mr. Carabello? No, there wasn't. So... I say... Why fight? Iving. This is wznn, your easy listening station. Well, then, don't drive. [Knock on door] Someone who drops in after a beautiful dinner is damned rude. I'm not Philip. I'm Michael. Hello, Michael. I dropped by to thank you for piero. Not a moment too soon. When my mother died, I was very young. She had cancer. They put her in Sloan-kettering. The kids weren't allowed to visit. And took me and my brother every day to this playground outside her hospital window so she could watch US play. My aunt told me that story when I was first going out with boys. She said, "what your father did for your mother, "that was love. It took a while before I could give a decent kiss without wondering if this guy would play with the kids outside my window while I died. Have you stopped asking yourself that? Almost completely. I saw her at a dance concert down in Chelsea. She was beautiful. I went back there every night just to watch her spin around and chant some African tongue. But the way she moved, the way she took in the whole audience with her eyes, conjured up this rush of images. Then I got to know her, and the real flesh and blood images took over. You have to say good-bye to all those... You know... Expectations. Yeah. Great expectations. You're a wonderful man, Michael. ♪ Love her today ♪ ♪ find 100 ways ♪ ♪ don't forget there could be ♪ ♪ an old lover in her memory ♪ ♪ if you need her so much more ♪ ♪ why don't you say ♪ ♪ maybe she has it ♪ ♪ in her mind ♪ ♪ she's just... ♪ Lisa? Mike, what are you doing here? Nothing. Just chewing the fat, shooting the breeze. Where's the old man? The old man's gone home. Michael ate your dinner. Yeah? How was it? Where were you, Philip? I'm sorry, Lisa. I got held up. With what, Philip? I'm sorry. I wasn't ready to meet your father. This was important to me. It should have been to you. What's important to you is important to me? Yes! I deserve better than this. I'm smart, pretty, and funny. There are plenty of guys who would be proud to have me and pleased as punch to have the key to my apartment. When she... When she brought up this key exchange, half of me said, "go ahead." The other half said, "go ahead, but you remember... "Somewhere dodown the line, "one of you will meet somebody else "or do somhing, you took a good thing and hinged it on keys and commitments. I'd like my keys back. Give me my keys. Come on, you guys. Here. This does not mean we don't see each other. Yes, it does. Exchanging keys doesn't work, but we're not finished. I'd like you to leave now. Please, leave! Good morning. Everything ok? I just heard about frank. [Knock on door] Come in! You heard. [Begins Beethoven's fifth symphony] I've come to give my resignation. You're doing the loyalty bit, hmm? I came with him. I ought to go. I believe your sincerity. We have a lot to talk about, madame producer. What? We'll go into it over lunch. Wait a minute. David! What are you pushing so hard for, Phil? You're in a foul mood today, aren't you? I'm going to take a pull. Don't come in so quick! Let's pull over here. Phil! Jesus! No. You're not seeing her anymore? I don't know. You don't know? That's what I said. I told you last week, it's basic differences. You shouldn't let her get away. Did you get back together with your wife? No, we've-- don't give me advice to the lovelorn. Married 1 1/2 months, his wife walks out, t that. What? In the little shorts. The blonde? Yeah, without the bra. They're very free. She looks like Candice Bergen. Oh! What are you doing tonight? Nothing. Since we're not seeing anyone, maybe we should go out and mingle. No. I don't know. Come on, man. We hit a few bars, meet some nice uncomplicated ladies. We'll have a few cocktails and some laughs. Maybe see some strange new panties. I have thought about it. Of course. A man has needs. I'm really awkward in these situations. You'll do fine. Just sit there and look sharp. You could do that. Just nod and smile once in a while. It all comes back. It's just like riding a bicycle. Hey, Mac! Can I get a drink down here? I'm with Jackie tonight. So he's standing there. I can't tell whether this is a man or a woman. So what the hell. People are people. It's full of protein. 30 a tablespoon. A teaspoon. How do you know? Hey! Lawyer! Lawyer! Lawyer, editor. Editor, lawyer. Independent filmmaker, lawyer. And you? Philip's a famous writer. Writer, editor. What do you write? Mysteries. Forget it. You haven't. Advertising copy. Powerful industry, advertising. Maybe too powerful. You think? They gave a test to a third grade class. Over half of them spelled relief r-o-l-a-i-d-s. I got milos to look at my shorts. Your shorts? My movies. Oh! I did these 18 5-minute films having all these affairs. The guy that cut it also did disco disaster. Uh-huh. He did it as a favor. Hey, babe. Isn't that Randy Madigan, the actor? Stoned as usual. Wow! You know him? When we did a little necking. Is that what you call it? You certainly couldn't call it fucking. Hey, Philip! What? You're not leaving? We're leaving. Mike, our ship is sailing. Get in there. [Singing in Spanish] In high school, I was self-conscious. I used to walk down the halls holding my books like this. Then, one day, I overheard two male teachers discussing my development. I just wanted to die. I wanted to transfer. Glad you chose to transfer. Neat. This is so neat. I was looking for a place like this for one of my father's affairs. Huh? You know, one of the movies I was telling you about. I'm going to open a window. ♪ I know, I know ♪ ♪ I know, I know ♪ ♪ just what you need ♪ ♪ tonight ♪ ♪ I know, I know ♪ ♪ just what you need ♪ ♪ tonight ♪ ♪ every time you smile at me ♪ ♪ you make it good ♪ ♪ you make it mine ♪ ♪ there's a debt unpaid ♪ ♪ and the note is due ♪ ♪ coming down the line ♪ ♪ headed right at you ♪ ♪ I'm in charge of putting it together ♪ ♪ making it tighter ♪ ♪ placing the pieces just right ♪ ♪ I know, I know ♪ ♪ tonight ♪ ♪ I know, I know ♪ [Change rattling] ♪ I know, I know ♪ ♪ midnight approaches ♪ ♪ the moment's at hand ♪ ♪ your heart starts moving with the next plan ♪ ♪ shadows are shifting on the bedroom wall... ♪♪ Hi.

Special. April. What do you want me to do? I want you to leave. I... I want... I want you to leave me alone so I can be alone tonight and think all this through. So I'll be ready for you tomorrow. Tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Tomorrow. Michael... Huh? That's so nice. Bye. Bye. Was that your girlfriend? That was my wife. Oh, wow! This is so cinematic. Ooooh! [Bike horn] Hey, this is great. Where'd you find this little thing? I used to have this bright green schwinn. It had this big spring in the front. Kind of like a shock absorber. God, I loved that schwinn. The position of the handlebars you could lower them, reverse them. Haven't thought about that for a long while. Steering my green schwinn. What is this area called? Turtle bay? Murry hill? What? You're not going to make a pass, are you? At her place, I don't feel like it or feel like feeling like it. I'm feeling very... Strange. I leave. Grab a couple drinks, call Lisa. I blather something into the phone. She says, "sleep it off." Dr. Chan to the emergency room. You know what you have to do. She's in Chicago with slattery. Meeting with people from another network. I'm so excited for Lisa. Something really big is going on. Chicago? Yeah. All week. You ok, Philip? I understand it got crazy. Well, I'll tell Lisa that you came by.

How could I miss the wedding? Right. Hey! Loraine is the best you could do? For 200 bucks. Who will marry a guy who can't speak English? She makes that in one night! They're divorcing in Haiti. I think they're very happy together. Be good. Oh. Hi. Hi. Hey, mazel tov, piero, really. April! What? This is for you. Bye. Adios. Adios? How's remarried life? It's great! Terrific! It's good.

Thank you. We're very happy. Great. Bye. See you. How are you? Good. And you? I'm fine. You know, I tried to call you this week. I was out of town. I know. Look, i'm... I'm real sorry about dinner with your father. That's ok. Cut that out. Should I read the no-regrets clause? You wrote it. Right. I want to be with you. We tried that. I didn't really try. I could do better. It's not a question of better or worse. I don't want to mold you into the right man for me. I can't be with you as a couple anymore. It was so much... I finally realized we care about each other very much, but we.... We rock and roll just great, but we can't dance close without stepping on each others' toes. Give me half a chance. I'd like to think we could see each other ve got to read shotgun wedding. Five-minute warning. Jesus, can I call you later? You can't. Tomorrow. Tomorrow's no good. Anytime this week. I won't be here. We're going to L.A. Yeah... I see. It's a position that would take me years to get to here. Sure. Three-minute warning. All riders... You better go. Philip! Something? I'm not calling it shotgun wedding anymore. What are you calling it? The bride came D.O.A. One-minute warning. All riders must be at the starting line. For making this race possible. Spectators are reminded this is a 100-kilometer race, 12 laps around the park. An awards ceremony will be following at the conclusion of the race. Riders must have their numbers low on their backs. Repeat-- low on their backs. This is most important. In the event of a breakaway-- how you doing? You ok? Great. I'm ok. Sure? Yeah. So, what did Lisa say? It doesn't matter. What do you mean? We got to race. I know. You don't look ready to race. I'm totally fucking ready to race. A gunshot signals... She's going to L.A. What? She's leaving for Los Angeles. Why? To work. Who knows? When? Now. Stand by for... What will you do? It's too late. Go after her. She is in slattery's limousine! So? [Gunshot] She doesn't love him. She loves you. You're too much of an asshole to realize that. Don't you love her? Huh? Do you? Yes. In front of that limousine. Show her you love her. What are you doing?

Oh, thank god! Are you all right? I'm lousy. Help me with this thing. What? Come on. Philip... Sorry to barge in on you. Hello, Philip. Nice to see you again. Would you hold this? Get in. What are you doing? Ok, driver. Airport. Philip... Let's say I go to L.A. with you. I'm a writer. Let's say I find a nice little sublet. What happens when you're late for the fifth time this week because you're in a working dinner. I'm at taco bell. This enchilada is an aspiring actress who takes me I want to take her home, only we have this cohabitation situation. Philip. Don't laugh. This is important to me. Fine. You come to L.A. Don't blame me when you're writing chase scenes for hart to hart. That's canceled. I know a guy on Magnum. Maybe-- doesn't mean he can't write a novel. You could call it death valley girl. I like it.
