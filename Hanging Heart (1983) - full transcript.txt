Kill the light! Okay, everyone. Let's take it from the top one more time. And Denny, make sure you really look behind you. Okay, everyone. Let's go. Everyone! Service department, pickup 2. All right, all right. All right, more, more! Ooh! That was the most fun at an audition I ever had. You should've seen the beach house. It was gorgeous. You mean, you went to his house? Oh, yeah, afterward. He just wanted to talk about the part. After all, he is a producer. Oh, come on. I almost forgot. I told him about you. You should send him your picture. Forget it. Oh, come on, lighten up. What time is it? Oh, right. I'm supposed to meet him for dinner. Don't make such a big deal. See you at the next rehearsal. God! Damn, not again! Excuse me. Is this Mr. Elliott Scott's house? Yeah. You must be Denny Curtis. So? Well, you're a lucky man. Mr. Scott asked me to deliver this car to you. Here's the keys, just sign this, it's all yours. Now, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Did he really? I don't know what to do. He refuses to take it. What do you want me to do? Just leave the car there. I'll take care of it later. Okay. Did you get the deposition in the Lee case? No, Mr. Scott. It hasn't come in yet. I'll call you in Chicago as soon as we get it. Good. Well, you know where I'm staying. Anyway, I'll be in town the day after tomorrow. Good luck on the case, Mr. Scott. Thank you. I'll pick you up on Thursday. That'd be great. Hey, baby and hey baby... I can't believe I'm the only one that didn't get a part in the play. Come on, Julie. It wasn't right for you, there's gonna be other plays. I've got nothing. What do you mean? You're young and you're pretty. Oh, shit. That's okay. I'll make sure she gets home safely. Yeah. Thanks. Take care, okay? You, too. Goodbye. He got instinct! I mean, it's not fair. Don't look at me like that! Don't look at me. Why don't you talk to me? Come on, talk to me. You say I'm the crazy one? It's you, you know. You're the crazy one. Even killing you isn't enough. You gotta die. Your life is over with now, you didn't know who you were dealing with. Go on, hit me. Go on, hit me. Hit me! Go on, hit me! Hit me! God. Not again. Denny, Denny... I didn't mean to upset you. Elliot, a car is generous, but I can't take it. Okay guys, that's it for today. And please, be on time for final dress rehearsal Tuesday. Cathy, you know I... Richard, I told you a million times. Don't. Goodbye. See ya. See you. Bye. Take care. See you, Denny. When are you leaving? Cathy, be on time next rehearsal. You seem to be late every time. I'll see you tomorrow then. All right? You know, Denny... Professional actors don't really fool around with each other. You know, this play could really help your career. In fact, I have some really big agents coming to see the play. Maybe I should just give Richard the lead. But the guy is still out there. You're the police. I'm sorry. Well, you know, I... I'm sorry, ma'am. If you aren't hurt, there's nothing we can do. He's really sick. Richard's got his own problems. Stop it! Stop it! There's nobody around. Fuck you! He's got a gun! You got shit for brains! Don't mess with me! You leave me alone! You're all crazy! All of yous! All right, it's okay. Calm down. Everybody get back to work, he's all right. If you use the gun, you could get yourself in deep shit, buddy. It's up to you. You can shoot one of us right now, or you can walk outta here. We won't stop you. Okay? So do whatever. No! You got that file? Put it on my desk, will ya? Jesus Christ. Here's the file on the dead girl. Leave it there. "When I came out from the restroom, I found she was dead." What do you think this is? Kindergarten? Let's stop playing games and tell me the truth. Look at me, you punk! I didn't do it, I swear. I want my lawyer. Empty your pockets. Take off your clothes, including your underwear. Bend down. I said including your underwear. What the..? Just do it. Lift your feet. Spread 'em. Welcome aboard, punk. Sam here. This is my big boss. What's your name? Just leave me alone, will you? Come on, I said knock it off. Hey, kid. Stop it! Yeah! God damn it, I can't stand this nuthouse! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Ju... Joanne. No, I can't. I can't discuss this with you right now. Hello? Hi, it's Frank. Hi, Frank. Listen. I'm afraid we're going to have to postpone the opening for a couple of weeks. Wait a minute. What on earth are you talking about? Do you know what you're saying? Yes. Listen, something's come up. I'm afraid we have no alternatives. Look, I can explain this to you later if you... No. I won't allow it, no way. We have a tight schedule. I put too much money into advertising. The play goes up as planned. I'm sorry. It can't go up right now. We can discuss this later. Right now, as the director of the play, I feel it's in the best interest of the show to postpone. We can... Joanne, you know I could play that lead just as well as Denny. And we could use the understudy for Cathy. For God's sakes, Richard! How can you talk to me about a role in a time like this? You talk as if you've waited for this day. Elliot, are you happy? I worry about you. Hold your head back. Dad. Keep your head back up. Come on, pop. Just hold your head back. Hold your... Mr. Scott, you have a phone call. It's Kenny somebody. Just a minute. - It sounds urgent. - Pop. You're gonna have to hold this yourself. I'll be right back. My God. What happened to you? How did you get that? It's nothing, Elliot. I feel awkward about this. I need your help. It's no problem. Glad to be able to help. Now, tell me what happened. I don't know where to begin. Denny. If I'm going to represent you, I need to know every detail. I want you to tell me the absolute truth. Cathy, where are you? Come on, stop teasing me. Did you see the custodian before you went to the restroom? I don't remember. Now, it says in the police report that the custodian witnessed the crime, and he saw you trying to hide the body... No, that's not true. Well, I'll see what I can find out about that. In the meantime, don't say anything to anyone. First thing we've gotta do is get you outta here on bail. Denny. Don't worry. Everything's going to be okay. Hey, look, I got something. Mm. We'll take this for evidence. Do you suppose I could speak to him, nurse? Yes, but you need to keep it short. Dad. You all right? I'm so sorry, Dad. I didn't mean to leave you. I'm so sorry. It must have been a nightmare, Denny. But don't worry, I'm sure Elliot will do his best. Even if he's not getting paid. It's really nice for him to help us out. Well, I'm very glad that you're helping us with this. I know how fond you are of Denny and I'm sure you'll do your best. I feel so much better now. See, Denny? Everyone's concerned about you. Everything will be okay, but we have to be very careful from now on. Come in. Hi. David, here you are. This is David Coleman. He's going to be helping me with the investigation. Joanne Dixon, director of Denny's... Hi, nice to meet you. And you must be Denny. Thanks so much for your help in this. Oh, no, you don't have to thank me. Thank Mr. Scott. He's the one that's paying me. Hi, Bob. How you doin'? Okay, Julie. How are you? Oh, good. Hey, look at this. Denny, it's early. Well, I'm pretty tired. I better get some sleep. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Try not to worry, okay? Okay. Good night. Goodnight. You're home early tonight. Oh, you're home. That's nice. I didn't know you were religious. Everybody prays in a difficult situation. I wish it was that easy. Denny. I really hate to see you like this. Do you remember when you came to rent a room from me 11 months ago? I said to myself, "Now there's a man who can stand up to anything." I hope you're right. Hi. I'll take this one, please. Good choice. And this one, too. Thank you. How about that? You look marvelous. Now you look respectable enough to go before the judge. Have you ever used a pantyhose to enhance your sexual experience? For instance, deriving pleasure from strangling a certain part of a woman's body? No, never. Then have you ever kept a woman's pantyhose at home for any other purpose? No. Then how do you explain this, found in your room? Or this one that was used at the time of the murder? How can you explain these same pantyhoses being in your possession? Objection, Your Honor. The question is compounded. Objection overruled. The defendant will answer the question. Mr. Curtis. Isn't it true that you're an actor? Yes, I am. And isn't it also true that you often rehearse scenes with your fellow actors and actresses in your home? Objection, Your Honor! Irrelevant. Council will direct the line of questioning. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm getting to the point. Do they ever change clothes for rehearsal at your home? Yes. And where do they change? In my room. Now, think back. The stocking that they found in your room, common enough colored one, could've been anyone's, right? It's stated here that on Friday, May the 13th, you witnessed the murder on the way to clean up the stage, and then ran away in fear. Is this all true? Please answer the question, yes or no. Um, yeah, yes. And also, isn't it true that you saw the defendant dragging the body in order to hide it? Yeah. Yeah, yes. You took an oath to tell nothing but the truth. Now, I want you to calm yourself and take time to answer my question. Now, tell me exactly what you saw at the scene of the crime. Well, that man over there was holding the dead woman. In other words, he was dragging her like this. Or would you say he was just holding her? Yeah, yeah. Just like that. Objection, Your Honor. The counselor is attempting to lead the witness. Objection overruled. How far would you say you were standing from the scene of the crime? Would you say about 50 feet? Yeah, I guess so. Does that mean yes? Well, I got these bad eyes. I can't see so good when it's dark. No more questions, Your Honor. The witness will step down. By the way, sir, do I get paid for this or not? You know, I've been waiting here all day. Court is recessed until June 30th at 9:30 a.m. Can you tell us what the prospect of this case is? What's your plan? I have no comment. Tell us about the status of your defendant right now. Excuse me. We still have plenty of time. We've got to get some solid evidence on him. What we have now is all too circumstantial. I just know the son of a bitch is guilty. We'll get him for sure. I hope so. Hey, Denny. Come on, cheer up. Things are looking up already, aren't they? Listen... I need to go. Okay, goodnight. Well, well, well. Another one of those love triangles. What did you say? What I'm saying is that Ms. Joanne Dixon probably didn't like the competition. I can't buy that insinuation. There isn't enough motivation. Besides, we need her as a character witness. Anyway, I still suspect Denny, too. When you consider his erratic behavior... don't you think so? Come on, can't you see anyone? Can't you think of anyone? Maybe someone was jealous of your girl, Cathy. Maybe someone had a grudge against you. Come on, think. Come on, Denny. Who is it? Well, then, what was the reason? Why did you kill her? Why did you kill her? - I didn't kill her! - Wake up! Now this is your life that we're talking about! That God damn fuckin' bitch... Son of a bitch. What's the problem, huh? Why'd you tell Frank, huh? Why'd you tell Frank I couldn't fill in for Denny's part for lead, huh? I wanna know why. Gee, what's the matter with you? Can't you see I'm tired? I want you to get out of here. I'm going call the police. Go ahead. Come on. You've been screwing me over long enough on Denny's account. You'd do anything for that son of a bitch, huh? I'm gonna make him pay for the pain, okay? I don't know what are you talking about. I know what's going on. I bet the good old Cathy is up there praying for you, huh? Hmm? Do you like to play around the nursing home? Yeah. Pretty nice folks. - Yeah. - Yeah. So what do you wanna be when you grow up? Bang, bang, a policewoman! Dad. You all right, Dad? Dad. Dad? Objection, Your Honor. The question is compounded. Now, think back. Could've been anyone's, right? Or was he just holding her? No! It's all right, Denny. You were just having a bad dream. Hey, who's there? Who is it? Denny? Denny! Oh, Denny. You scared me. What are you doing here? Hey... What are you doing? Huh? What's gotten into you? What is this? Let me get this off. I must've killed her. No, you didn't, Denny. No, you didn't, Denny. Don't ever say you did. I didn't, huh? No, you didn't. How do you know that? You didn't, I know you didn't. Did you kill her then? Yes. Say it. Yes, yes. Say it. Yes. - Louder, I can't hear you. - Yes! Yes! - Say it! Yes! You were great, Denny. It's getting late. I'm gonna get going, sweet dear. Hello? Joanne? Hi, Frank. Yes, it's Joanne. Oh, I'm sorry I couldn't make it, but something came up. By the way, how's the trial going? Well, I guess it's going okay. Anyway, as soon as the trial's over, we'll reschedule the show. I promise. Will you keep me posted? Yes, of course I'll keep you posted. By the way, are you going to the party at Tina's? No, I don't think so. Aw. Well, it just won't be any fun without you. Joanne? You're still not answering. Joanne? Joanne? Joanne, answer me! Joanne! Let's go! Crazy son of a bitch. You did it again, huh? Come on. Come on, let's go. No! Elliot. You gotta get me outta here. Please. I can't stand another... - Denny! - day in here. Please. - Guard. You gotta get me out of here. Guard! Guard! Guard! Please, help. Please! Is there anybody? Come on, I just want someone to talk to. Hey, anybody, y'all want to talk? I don't want to be alone like this, please! Shut up! You and I both know he's a damn psychopath and acts fucking naive. Every time I'm practically this close, still can't nail the bastard. It'll be fuckin' impossible to find fingerprints on these documents. But there were fingerprints all over the house. We haven't got them where we need them. I guess we should have known from his medical history. Your guy Denny... Looks guilty to me. He's not guilty. You know what? It's gotta be Richard. I'm sure of it. I want you to dig around a little. Well, I think Denny's the man. I'm not paying you to argue with me! Your Honor. You know you can't keep my client in jail based solely on circumstantial evidence. Look, we let the guy out before and we wound up with another murder. He's a psychopathic killer. You know my client has no motive to kill anyone. You can't hold him just because he happens to be at the scene of a crime. Haven't you read his medical history? He killed his mother at the age of 10. You can't put my client in jail based on something that happened 15 years ago! You may be a big shot in PI, but you're over your head. Okay, now quiet! Now let's get back to the case. Now, what do you want me to do? I can't let this guy out, yet I can't really hold him in jail. Where do you want me to put him? Come on. Get him in there. Got it. That's good, come on. Please! Help me! Help me! Please, help me. Denny doesn't belong here. I need you to certify that he's competent. Well, I can't draw any conclusions as yet, Mr. Scott. He simply refuses to cooperate. All right. Thank you. Okay, where do I find him? Hallway, then to the left. Denny. Denny. Talk to me. Please. Say something. Denny, please. Since I got here, I feel very peaceful. Denny, don't give up. I'm feeling at home. We've gotta fight. This is more important to me than if my own life depended on it. All right, let's go! Stop it. Everybody, just calm down. Right now, calm down. Did you kill your mother? I don't know, I don't know. I know it's very difficult, but try to remember. It's important. You mentioned you lived with your mother and your stepfather. Where was your stepfather all this time? Think, Denny. Stop, stop! Stop it! Don't! Don't! It must have been an awful experience for you and a terrible burden to carry around all these years. Have you ever seen your stepfather after that night? No. Denny, do you wanna go on? Well, at least some good came of the fight. You were able to open up to me. But from now on, try to stay out of trouble. What is your profession? I'm a psychiatrist. And what exactly do you do? I'm in charge of diagnosing a patient's condition and then initiating a treatment plan for the patient. And what was your diagnosis for the defendant? Do you find him emotionally sound? Yes. He does have problems, but he's been talking and working on those problems, and now he seems quite competent. You said he's competent. Would you say he's normal? Yes. Well, how would you define normal and abnormal? Well, everyone suffers from psychological problems from time to time, even you or me. The difference is, normal people are aware of such problems and are able to control it. Have you ever seen the defendant acting abnormally? Yes. I thought he was suffering from some hatred of women. Yeah. He's the kind of guy that likes to abuse women and kills. Objection, Your Honor. Sustained. Who knows, huh? I want to take you back to the time when you were 10. Specifically, the incident involving you with your mother, Mrs. Curtis. Well, I don't wanna remember. Objection, Your Honor. Irrelevant! You yourself once pursued the late Ms. Cathy Andrews in vain, and also you threatened the late Joanne Dixon for her refusal to use you in a part. Is that not true? Who's been feeding you all these lies, huh? You've been disgruntled and spiteful with the defendant over various roles. That's a bunch of lies! Now, you'd drag up anything to protect that Denny! Your Honor. This has nothing to do with this case. Just answer my question. Have you or have you not been jealous of the defendant? Order, order! I can't believe the judge let that maniac free on bail again. The pattern is so damn clear. The guy kills every time he gets hot. So now you know how to catch him in the act. I've got to nail that son of a bitch. You know damn well how important this is to both our careers. Yeah. Do you think this case will have an effect on your candidacy for the upcoming mayoral election? That has no bearing on this case. You've been a very successful prosecutor in the past. Are you having difficulty with this particular case? No comment. Excuse me. It must have been pretty rough on you. Well, at least you're out. I think the doctor's letter helped. I talked to your theater group. They're 100% behind you. Come on. We've got a lot of work to do. The trial's coming up. I don't want any help from you. Denny, what are you saying? Denny! Denny! Look, just leave me alone! I'm dirt! Can't you see it on everything I touch? - Denny? - What do you want me to do? Touch you and make love to you and say thank you? This is some place you've taken me to. Here, sit down. - Thank you. Will you excuse me for a moment? I'll be right back. Sure, go ahead. Hi, Denny. Good to see you. How are you? How do you think I'm doing? I know, it's terrible. Is there anything I could do for you? No, I don't think so. Thanks, anyway. Well, it was nice seeing you again, anyways. I gotta go. You take care, okay? Do you mind if we go somewhere else? No, whatever you say. Okay, great. Huh? Have we subpoenaed every witness who can support our case? Yes, I did that. Make sure you obtain Richard's criminal file. I want the jury to hear about that. I've already done that. Good. Anything there? He was arrested twice for rape, assault, and battery, after he left the foster home. Let me see the file. Elliot, I want to talk to you. Hi, David. Elliot. What's wrong with David? Ah, you know how those detectives are. I let him go. He wasn't helping your case, anyway. Anyhow, I'm glad you're here. I've got some things to talk over. First of all... Denny. Denny, look, I'm sorry to be bothering you, but I thought I might find you here and I... I appreciate that, but not now. Maybe later. Just leave me alone, okay? But I could be a great listener. Thanks, but no thanks. Call me! Is this Julie? Who is this? Ah, Julie. I dream of holding you every night. I don't know who you are, but I think you're sick. Stop screaming, bitch. Must've had a bad dream, huh? What'd you dream about? That psychopath, Denny? Huh? You don't know what he does. You'll end up digging your own grave. Why don't you want me instead? I've been dreaming about you. Okay, okay. I'll do whatever you say. Don't do anything stupid, you bastard. Now get out! Move it! That's right. Keep walking. You maniac! If you ever do anything like this again, I'll blow your fucking head off. Okay, okay, it's cool, I'm leaving. But remember... I wouldn't tell anybody about this if I were you. We don't know what will happen. David, David! Talk to me! Why'd you quit? What's going on? Denny. You're late. You've gotta get up early in the morning for the trial. I'll meet you at the courthouse at 9:00, I got something to do earlier. Get a good night's sleep. All right. I'll see you in the morning. Goodnight. Shit! Taxi! Taxi! Hello, yes. Gold Cab, please. Thank you. Gold Cab? Yeah, I'm in a hurry. How fast can you get a cab here? 3rd and... Julie. Julie! Denny! All rise. The Honorable Judge Joseph Esworthy presiding. Please be seated. I'm sorry, sir. Judge, we have a slight problem. The defendant in this case still hasn't shown. We're gonna have to hold this case over for tomorrow. I'm sorry, sir. This case has been postponed until further notice. You can all be excused today from this court. All right, Counselor. You have anything to say now? Something must've happened, I'm sure. Your Honor. We ask that a bench warrant be issued. No. There must be a reason. The defendant is found guilty of premeditated murder on two counts. I hereby sentence you to death! No, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Welcome to death row. Slimy bastard! What's the point? Hey, we could both have our destiny fulfilled. What's the use of fighting now? You know, I feel so much better after killing Julie. She was a fucking backstabber. Richard! Richard! What are you doing? Hey, look. If you don't want her to end up in a noose, follow me. There's a smuggler's boat waiting for me. We'll go to Europe. If you stay here, you know what will happen to you. Well, make up your mind. This is your only chance. Come on. Fuck. Bye! I didn't want to be with this maniac! I really didn't want to! He killed the guard! Not me! Not me! Not me! Not me! I didn't do it! Denny! Nurse! Denny, calm down. Give me the hypodermic needle, fast! I gotta make a phone call! Dr. Davis, telephone please. Dr. Davis, telephone please. I'm looking for Denny Curtis. Have you seen him? Have you seen Denny Curtis today? No. No, he hasn't called in yet. Something must've happened to him. No, I have no idea. Elliot? Denny? Denny? Where are you? Hello? Is this Julie? Yes. This is Elliot. I wanted to thank you last night, but I guess I missed you. Anyway, it's very nice of you. Oh, it's no trouble. I'm just sorry for all of this happening. Don't worry about it. Just thank God he's all right. Yeah, the doctor says he should be out of here in just a few days. Maybe I should thank you for that, too. Oh, you're welcome. David! What the hell do you think you're doing? David, I wanna talk to you. I want to know what's going on. Please, just tell me what you know. Denny, I can't help you. Even if you're being framed! I can't get involved! Denny, just listen to me for one moment. Don't walk away from me like that! Denny, can't you see everything I've been doing for you? Why do you have to stick your nose in where it doesn't belong? Don't you know you could get hurt? Just let me handle things. Didn't you hear me? I told you I saw David today. Who's framing me? Who said anything about framing you? You're upset. Your mind is playing tricks on you. I don't know what David said, but he's just a junkie. Then why did you hire him? I didn't know. I had no idea until he refused to investigate Richard. He was pushing drugs on him. I had to let him go. I didn't want to tell you that. Denny, I'm the lawyer. Trust me. Hi, honey, it's me, Mom. You missed dinner again. Where have you been? Everybody's looking for you. Call me. Hello, Julie, you are not home. This is Sarkan. I am in charge briefly to purchase some more properties for my father-in-law. Please call me at Hotel Louis, Suite 200. My driver will pick you up as soon as you can be ready. Thank you very much, bye-bye. Hey, this is Larry. You remember me. No, no, no, no, no. You don't even need to call, he'll... Ms. White, this is the cleaners calling. Your stuff's ready, you can come down and pick it up tomorrow if you want. Bye. Julie-san. This is Mr. Fukamochi. You're not home. Well, I just got from Tokyo. You know where I'm staying. Call me, okay? Uh-oh. Aw, fuck. Julie, this is me again. I'm still waiting. What happened? Call me. What the fuck you think you're doing, huh? Do you think we spend all that money on you to screw around? The trial's coming up in two days. If you're gonna set up a trap, you better work fast. Do you understand? I'm trying. I... Yeah, yeah, yeah. What the fuck are you saying, huh? You're a hooker! Huh? Now, why can't you seduce him? This bracelet I gave you isn't for your looks, I want you to use it, and fast! You've got two days. So that's what you are, a hired hand. Turn around and look at me. Now I know why you were so devoted to me. The accident was a setup, wasn't it? No, no, it wasn't. It was an accident. What the hell are you gonna do now? How could you? How could you do that to me? What do you mean how could I? You know I was struggling, my career. How did you think I was living like this? I'd sell my soul to anybody who will pay me. God. What did I do? You're the first guy I ever really cared about since I could remember. Stupid, huh? I'd sell my soul to anybody who will pay me. If you're gonna set up a trap, you better work fast, do you understand? If you're gonna set up a trap, you better work fast. Set up a trap. Set up the trap. Yeah. Denny? Denny? Denny? Denny? Denny! Denny, where the hell are you going? Set up the trap. Set up the trap. Julie? Julie, it's time to go now. I'm about to close. Get the hell outta my way. Let's go! Hey! Hey man, we're closed! Shut the fuck up! Well, well, well. Denny's little bitch slut. Hey! You're coming with me now. Come on. Party's over, buddy. You screwed my life long enough, you fuckin' asshole. Denny! Denny! Stop it! Denny! Just keep... Get outside! What the hell do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? Did you forget you're out on bail? You wanna take out both of us? Just stay outta trouble! We got more important things to think about. Until this trial's over, don't push our luck any further. Come on, Denny, get in! He's after you, hurry! Come on! Get in the car before he comes. He's dead meat! You tell him that, you faggot! You okay? Yeah. 9-1-1 emergency. Tell Detective George McGill I got a surprise for him at 7250 Melbourne. Who's this? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Homicide to Detective George McGill. Homicide to Detective George McGill. There's been a homicide at 7250 Melbourne Avenue. One body, one male. David Coleman. Shit! Dead on arrival. Homicide. Oh, shit. Damn! Come on. Shit! Hang in there, baby, hang in there. Keep still or you're dead. Put out your hand, come on. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up this right, anything you say can... Denny. That's a 10-4. Wait. Denny. Southbound on Western Avenue. Two suspects on foot. Mr. Scott. What did you hope to get out of all of this? Oh, his love, of course. I loved him so much. They were taking him away from me. He belongs to me. I still love him so.
